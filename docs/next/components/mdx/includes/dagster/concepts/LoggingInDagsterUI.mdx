When jobs are run, the logs stream back to the [**Run details** page](/concepts/webserver/ui#run-details) in real time. The UI contains two types of logs - **structured event** and **raw compute** - which you can learn about using the tabs below.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Structured event logs">

### Structured event logs

Structured logs are enriched and categorized with metadata. For example, a label of which asset a log is about, links to an assetâ€™s metadata, and what type of event it is available. This structuring also enables easier filtering and searching in the logs.

- **Logs stream back to the UI in real time**:

- **Filtering log messages based on execution steps and log levels**:

<TabItem name="Raw compute logs">

### Raw compute logs

The raw compute logs contain logs for both [`stdout` and `stderr`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3385201/confused-about-stdin-stdout-and-stderr), which you can toggle between. To download the logs, click the **arrow icon** near the top right corner of the logs.

Custom log messages are also included in these logs. Notice in the following image that the `Hello world!` message is included on line three:
