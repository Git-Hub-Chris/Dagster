# Loading a CSV File to a Snowflake

Learn to load a CSV file into a Snowflake table using Dagster by making use of the `COPY INTO` query.

---

## What You'll Learn

You will learn how to:

- Configure the Snowflake resource in Dagster
- Use the Snowflake resource from a Dagster asset
- Write the contents of the CSV file to Snowflake using a `COPY INTO` query

---

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this guide, you will need:

- To have Dagster installed. Refer to the [Dagster Installation Guide](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/installation) for instructions.
- A basic understanding of Dagster. Refer to the [Dagster Documentation](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/what-why-dagster) for more information.
- A Snowflake account and the necessary credentials to connect to your Snowflake instance.
- A CSV file that you want to load into Snowflake.

---

## Steps to Implement With Dagster

By following these steps, you will have a Dagster asset that successfully reads a CSV file and writes its contents to a Snowflake table.

### Step 1: Define the Snowflake Resource

First, define the Snowflake resource in Dagster. This resource will be used to connect to your Snowflake instance.


<CodeExample filePath="usecases/copy-csv-to-snowflake/define-resource.py" language="python" title="Using a SnowflakeResource" />

### Step 2: Define the Asset to Read and Load the CSV File

Next, define the Dagster asset that reads the CSV file and writes its contents to a Snowflake table using a COPY INTO query.

<CodeExample filePath="usecases/copy-csv-to-snowflake/define-asset.py" language="python" title="Asset to copy a CSV" />

### Step 3: Configure and Run the Asset

Finally, configure the asset in the Dagster UI and run it to load the CSV file into the Snowflake table.

1. Start Dagster by running:

   ```sh
   dagster dev
   ```

2. Open the Dagster UI at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

3. Find the `load_csv_to_snowflake` asset and click on it.

4. Click on the "Launchpad" tab.

5. Run the asset to load the CSV file into the Snowflake table.

## Expected Outcomes

By following these steps, you will have successfully loaded a CSV file into a Snowflake table using Dagster. The data from the CSV file will be available in the specified Snowflake table for further processing or analysis.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the Snowflake credentials and connection details are correct.
- Verify that the CSV file path is correct and accessible.
- Check the Snowflake table schema to ensure it matches the CSV file structure.

---

## Next Steps

- Explore more advanced data loading techniques with Dagster and Snowflake.
- Integrate additional data sources and transformations into your Dagster pipeline.
