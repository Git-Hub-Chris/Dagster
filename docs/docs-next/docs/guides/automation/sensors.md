### Basic Sensor Example

This example includes a `check_for_new_files` function that simulates finding new files. In a real scenario, this function would check an actual system or directory.

The sensor runs every 5 seconds. If it finds new files, it starts a run of `my_job`. If not, it skips the run and logs "No new files found" in the Dagster UI.

:::tip

By default, sensors aren't enabled when first deployed to a Dagster instance.
Click "Automation" in the top navigation to find and enable a sensor.
