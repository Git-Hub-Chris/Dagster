# Dagster+ Insights

Using Dagster+ Insights, you can gain visibility into historical usage and cost metrics such as Dagster+ run duration, credit usage, and failures.
Visualizations are built right into the Dagster UI, allowing you to explore metrics from Dagster as well as downstream systems (like Google BigQuery) all in one place.

### With Insights, you can

- [Explore usage trends in your Dagster pipelines](#explore-dagsters-built-in-metrics)
- [Integrate additional metrics](#integrate-other-metrics), like data warehouse cost or your own custom metadata
- [Export metrics](#export-metrics) from Dagster+
- [Create alerts](/dagster-plus/deployment/alerts#alerting-when-an-insights-metric-crosses-a-threshold) based off of Insights metrics {/* TODO: write this alerts section) */}

## Explore Dagster's built-in metrics

To access Insights, click **Insights** in the top navigation bar in the UI:

![Viewing the Insights tab in the Dagster+ UI](/img/placeholder.svg)
{/* <Image

*/}

The left navigation panel on this page contains a list of available metrics. For each metric, the daily, weekly, or monthly aggregated values are displayed in the graph.

Use the tabs above the charts to view metrics for **Assets**, **Asset groups**, **Jobs**, and **Deployments**.

These metrics are updated on a daily basis. Refer to the [built-in metrics](#built-in-metrics) section for more information about what Dagster provides out of the box.


## Working with Insights metrics

### Data retention

How long historical Insights data is retained depends on your Dagster+ plan:

- **Dagster+ Pro** - 120 days
- **All other plans** - 30 days

### Integrate other metrics

Users on the Pro plan can integration other metrics into Insights, such as asset materialization metadata or Snowflake credits. Insights supports the following additional metrics:

- **Asset materialization metadata.** Refer to the [Using asset metadata with Dagster+ Insights guide](/dagster-plus/insights/asset-metadata) for more info.
- **Google BigQuery usage** generated by either [queries made to BigQuery resources](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery) or [using dbt to materialize tables](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery-and-dbt)
- **Snowflake usage** generated by either [queries made to Snowflake resources](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake) or [using dbt to materialize tables](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt)

### Export metrics

Metrics in Dagster+ Insights can be exported using a GraphQL API endpoint. Refer to the [Exporting Insights metrics from Dagster+ guide](/dagster-plus/insights/exporting-insights-metrics) for details.
