### About this integration

With `dagster-mlflow`, you can initialize an MLflow run and use it for all steps within a Dagster run. Additionally, you can access all of MLflow’s methods as well as the [MLflow tracking](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) client’s methods.

### Installation

```bash
pip install dagster-mlflow
```

### Example

```python
from dagster_mlflow import end_mlflow_on_run_finished, mlflow_tracking
from dagster import op, job

@op(required_resource_keys={"mlflow"})
def mlflow_op(context):
    context.mlflow.log_params(some_params)
    context.mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient().create_registered_model(some_model_name)

mlflow = mlflow_tracking.configured({
    "experiment_name": "my_experiment",
    "mlflow_tracking_uri": "http://localhost:5000",

    # if want to run a nested run, provide parent_run_id
    "parent_run_id": "an_existing_mlflow_run_id",

    # env variables to pass to mlflow
    "env": {
        "MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL": "my_s3_endpoint",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "my_aws_key_id",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "my_secret",
    },

    # env variables you want to log as mlflow tags
    "env_to_tag": ["DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG"],

    # key-value tags to add to your experiment
    "extra_tags": {"super": "experiment"},
})

@end_mlflow_on_run_finished
@job(resource_defs={"mlflow": mlflow})
def mlf_example():
    mlflow_op()
```
