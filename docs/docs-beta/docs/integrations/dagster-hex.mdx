### About this integration

Including Hex in your Dagster data pipelines and orchestration workflows lets you do things like:

- Trigger a Hex app to update cached values after an upstream transformation completes
- Run a Hex project with passed-in input parameters based on a form submission in another app
- Automatically kick off a model re-run through Hex when new source data lands

With this integration, you can call the Hex API to run a project until it completes.
Dagster Ops can return an `AssetMaterialization` of a Hex dataset.

### Installation

```bash
pip install dagster-hex
```

### Example

```python
from dagster_hex.resources import hex_resource
from dagster import job
from dagster_hex.ops import hex_project_op

API_KEY = 'abc123'
PROJ_ID = 'i-love-uuids'

my_resource = hex_resource.configured({'api_key': API_KEY})
run_hex_op = hex_project_op.configured(
    {"project_id": PROJ_ID},
    name='run_job'
)

@job(resource_defs={"hex": my_resource})
def hex_job():
    run_hex_op()
```

### About Hex

The Dagster **Hex** library lets Dagster users easily add Hex apps as assets in Dagster pipelines, executing runs of or accessing metadata about Hex apps in response to upstream events and triggers.
