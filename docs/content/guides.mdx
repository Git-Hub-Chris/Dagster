# Guides

Learn to apply [Dagster concepts](/concepts) to your work, explore experimental features, and check out some examples.

---

## General

### Development environment

- [Running Dagster locally](/guides/running-dagster-locally) - Learn how to run Dagster and its web UI on your local machine

### Working with data assets

- [Understanding how assets relate to ops and graphs](/guides/dagster/how-assets-relate-to-ops-and-graphs) - Learn how software-defined assets relate to ops and graphs, and when to use one over the other

- [Moving to Software-defined Assets](/guides/dagster/enriching-with-software-defined-assets) - Already using ops and graphs, but not Software-defined Assets? Learn why and how to use Software-defined Assets

- [Using Software-defined assets with Pandas and PySpark](/guides/dagster/software-defined-assets) - A quick introduction to Sofware-defined Assets, featuring Pandas and PySpark

- [Declarative scheduling for Software-defined assets](/guides/dagster/scheduling-assets) - Create data SLAs and schedule based on desired outcomes, not tasks

- [Testing assets](/guides/dagster/testing-assets) - Learn to test your Software-defined Assets

- [Assets without I/O](/guides/dagster/non-argument-deps) - Create and use assets without writing back to storage or reading data when used as inputs

### Working with tasks

- [Re-executing Dagster jobs](/guides/dagster/re-execution) - Learn to re-execute Dagster jobs using either the UI or Dagster's APIs

- [Intro to ops and jobs](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs) - Learn to execute tasks that don't produce assets

- [Migrating to graphs, jobs, and ops](https://docs.dagster.io/0.15.7/guides/dagster/graph_job_op) - **Legacy**. Migrate to Dagster graphs, jobs, and ops from Dagster solids and pipelines
