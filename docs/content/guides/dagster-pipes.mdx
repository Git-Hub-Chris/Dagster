# Dagster Pipes

Dagster Pipes is a toolkit for building integrations between Dagster and external execution environments. It standardizes the process of passing parameters, injecting context information, ingesting logs, and collecting metadata all while remaining agnostic to how remote computations are launched in those environments. This enables the separation of orchestration and business logic in the Dagster ecosystem.

It also smooths the process of incorporating pre-existing code, business logic, and execution environments into Dagster. Using Dagster Pipes, you add just a few lines to your code, and it becomes seamlessly invocable by the orchestrator. In turn, you can stream logs and metadata back to Dagster so you can leverage its observability, lineage, cataloging, and debugging capabilities.

## Benefits

With Dagster Pipes, you can:

- Incorporate existing code into Dagster without huge refactors
- Onboard stakeholder teams onto Dagster incrementally
- Run code in external environments, and:
  - Easily pass parameters to the code
  - Stream unstructured logs and structured metadata back to Dagster
- Separate orchestration and business logic environments
- Use languages other than Python with Dagster

## Limitations

While Dagster Pipes is lightweight and flexible, there are a few limitations to be aware of:

- **Step launchers are incompatible.**
- **I/O managers aren’t currently supported.** If you rely heavily on I/O managers in remote execution, we recommend using step launchers.

## How it works

Dagster Pipes provides a protocol between the orchestration environment (Dagster) and external execution (ex: Databricks) and a toolkit for building implementations of that protocol.

When Dagster Pipes is invoked, several steps will be carried out both in the **orchestration process**, or Dagster, and in the **external process**, such as Databricks.

### In the orchestration process (Dagster)

When the execution of a Dagster asset begins, Dagster makes context information (ex: `partition_key`, `asset_key`, etc.) available for the external process to consume.

Next, Dagster launches the external process and passes in any provided parameters.

### In the external process

The process starts and loads the context info provided by Dagster. When finished, the process sends execution data, logs, and any specified metadata, back to Dagster.

After Dagster receives the data from the external process, it’ll be visible in the [Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui).

**Note:** Depending on the technology you use (ex: Databricks, Docker), this implementation of the protocol may vary. Refer to the [Understanding Dagster Pipes process guide](/guides/dagster-pipes/understanding-dagster-pipes) for more info.

## Usage

Ready to get started with Dagster Pipes? Depending on what your goal is, how you approach using Dagster Pipes will differ:

- **If you’re writing code that's being orchestrated by Dagster**, all you’ll need to do is lightly modify your existing code. Refer to the [Modifying existing code to work with Dagster Pipes](/guides/dagster-pipes/modifying-existing-code-to-work-with-dagster-pipes) guide for more info and examples.
- **If you need to orchestrate code others have written,** you can use our ready-to-go integrations to execute code in your chosen technology:
  - [Databricks](/guides/dagster-pipes/integrating-databricks-with-dagster-pipes)
  - [Docker](/guides/dagster-pipes/integrating-docker-with-dagster-pipes)
  - [Kubernetes](/guides/dagster-pipes/integrating-kubernetes-with-dagster-pipes)
  - [Subprocess](/guides/dagster-pipes/integrating-subprocess-with-dagster-pipes)
- **If you don’t see your integration or you want to fully customize your Pipes experience,** use these in-depth guides to get up to speed:
