# Running Dagster locally

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to run Dagster on your local machine using the `dagster dev` command.

**Looking for installation help?** Refer to the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install).

---

## Understanding the dagster dev command

The `dagster dev` command launches [the Dagster webserver/UI](/concepts/webserver/ui) and the [Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon), allowing you to start a full deployment of Dagster from the command line.

This command should be run in a Python environment where the `dagster` and `dagster-webserver` packages are installed. **Once started, the process should be kept running.**

## Locating your code

Before you can start developing, you need to tell Dagster how to find the Python code containing your assets and jobs. There are a few ways to do this, which are outlined in the tabs below.

**Note**: If using an example Dagster project, or if you used the [`dagster` CLI to create a project](/getting-started/create-new-project#step-1-bootstrap-a-new-project), you can run the `dagster dev` command in the same folder as the project to load the project code.

## Configuration

- [Run and asset storage](#asset-and-run-storage)
- [Local instance](#local-instance)

### Asset and run storage

When running `dagster dev`, you may see log output that looks like this:

```shell
Using temporary directory /Users/rhendricks/tmpqs_fk8_5 for storage.
```

This indicates that any runs or materialized assets created during your session won't be persisted once the session ends. This can be useful when using Dagster for temporary local development or testing, when you don't care about the results being persisted.

To designate a more permanent home for your runs and assets, you can set the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable to a folder on your filesystem. Dagster will then use the specified folder for storage on all subsequent runs of `dagster dev`.

### Local instance

You can optionally use a `dagster.yaml` file to configure your Dagster instance - for example, to configure [run concurrency limits](/guides/limiting-concurrency-in-data-pipelines) or specify that runs should be stored in a [Postgres database](/deployment/dagster-instance#postgres-storage) instead of on the filesystem.

If the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable is set, `dagster dev` will look for a `dagster.yaml` file in the `DAGSTER_HOME` folder. If `DAGSTER_HOME` is not set, `dagster dev` will look for that file from the folder where the command was run.

For the full list of options that can be set in the `dagster.yaml` file, refer to the [Dagster instance documentation](/deployment/dagster-instance).

### Exposing the dev server

You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the `dagster dev` server to the internet. ngrok is a globally distributed gateway that provides secure connectivity for applications and services running in any environment.

This can be useful for sharing your work with others or for testing integrations with external systems.

You will need a free authtoken. To obtain one, sign up for free at [ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and retrieve it from the [authtoken page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) in your ngrok dashboard.

Set `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` on your shell:

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_token_here
echo 'export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your_token_here' >> ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc / ...
```

This token is your personal access token, so keep it secret and don't add it to your repository.

Make sure the `ngrok` [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/ngrok/) is installed in the same environment where the `dagster` and `dagster-webserver` packages are installed and use the `--ngrok` flag.

```bash
pip3 install ngrok # if necessary
dagster dev --ngrok
```

This will output your temporary ngrok URL on your console. You can share this link, which will stay valid until you shut down the dev server.

To use a static domain, you can set `NGROK_DAGSTER_DOMAIN`:

```bash
export NGROK_DAGSTER_DOMAIN=mydomain.ngrok.dev
dagster dev --ngrok
```

Make sure you've registered your domain on your ngrok dashboard beforehand.

For advanced features, such as limiting the access to the domain via OAuth, and to use other features, please see the [ngrok documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/).

## Moving to production

`dagster dev` is primarily useful for running Dagster for local development and testing. It isn't suitable for the demands of most production deployments. Most importantly, `dagster dev` does not include authentication or web security. Additionally, in a production deployment, you might want to run multiple webserver replicas, have zero downtime continuous deployment of your code, or set up your Dagster daemon to automatically restart if it crashes.

For information about deploying Dagster in production, refer to the [Deploying Dagster guides](/deployment/open-source#deploying-dagster).
