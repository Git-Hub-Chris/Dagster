# Using environment variables and secrets

<EnvironmentVariablesIntro />

---

## Declaring environment variables

How environment variables are declared depends on how your Dagster project is deployed.

### Dagster Cloud

Environment variables can be set a variety of ways in Dagster Cloud. Refer to the [Dagster Cloud environment variables guide](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets) for more info.

### Dagster Open Source

Setting environment variables in Dagster Open Source depends on where Dagster is deployed. Refer to the deployment guide for your platform for more info:

## Accessing environment variables

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to access environment variables once they've been declared. There are two ways to do this:

- [In Python code](#in-python-code), which isn't specific to Dagster
- [From Dagster configuration](#from-dagster-configuration), which incorporates environment variables into the Dagster type system

### In Python code

To access environment variables in your Dagster code, you can use [`os.getenv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv):

```python
import os

database_name = os.getenv("DATABASE_NAME")
```

This approach also works for accessing [built-in environment variables for Dagster Cloud](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets#built-in-environment-variables):

```python
import os

deployment_name = os.getenv("DAGSTER_CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_NAME")
```

Refer to the [Dagster Cloud Branch Deployments example](#example-2-dagster-cloud-branch-deployments) for a real-world example.

### From Dagster configuration

[Configurable Dagster objects](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) - such as ops, assets, resources, I/O managers, and so on - can accept configuration from environment variables.

To access an environment variable as part of a Dagster configuration, use the following syntax:

```python
"PARAMETER_NAME": {"env": "ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME"}
```

For example:

```python
"access_token": {"env": "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN"}
```

Refer to the [Handling secrets section](#handling-secrets) and [Per-environment configuration example](#example-1-per-environment-configuration) for examples.

## Handling secrets

Using environment variables to provide secrets ensures sensitive info won't be visible in your code or the launchpad in the UI. In Dagster, best practice for handling secrets uses [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) and [resources](/concepts/resources).

A resource is typically used to connect to an external service or system, such as a database. Resources can be configured separately from the rest of your app, allowing you to define it once and reuse it as needed.

Let's take a look at an example from the [Dagster Crash Course](https://dagster.io/blog/dagster-crash-course-oct-2022), which creates a GitHub resource and supplies it to assets in a Dagster repository. Let's start by looking at the resource:

```python
## resources.py

from dagster import StringSource, resource
from github import Github

@resource(config_schema={"access_token": StringSource})
def github_api(init_context):
    return Github(init_context.resource_config["access_token"])
```

Let's review what's happening here:

- This code creates a GitHub resource named `github_api`
- Using <PyObject object="ConfigSchema" />, we've indicated that resource can accept a single config parameter, `access_token`
- Using <PyObject object="StringSource" />, we've indicated that the `access_token` config parameter can either be:
  - An environment variable, or
  - Provided directly in the configuration

As storing secrets in configuration is bad practice, we'll opt for using an environment variable. In this code, we're configuring the resource and supplying it to assets in the repository:

```python
## repository.py

from dagster import (
    load_assets_from_package_module,
    repository,
    with_resources,
)
from my_dagster_project import assets
from my_dagster_project.resources import github_api

@repository
def my_dagster_project():
    return [
        with_resources(
            load_assets_from_package_module(assets),
            {"github_api": github_api.configured({"access_token": {"env": "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN"}})},
        ),
    ]
```

Let's review what's happening here:

- Using <PyObject object="with_resources" /> adds the `github_api` resource to the assets in the repository. In assets, we'll use the `github_api` resource key to reference the resource.
- Using the <PyObject object="configured" /> method on the `github_api` resource, we can pass configuration info to the resource. In this example, we're telling Dagster to load the `access_token` from the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Parameterizing pipeline behavior

Using environment variables, you define how your code should execute at runtime.

- [Per-environment configuration](#example-1-per-environment-configuration)
- [Dagster Cloud Branch Deployments](#example-2-dagster-cloud-branch-deployments)

### Example 1: Per-environment configuration

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use different I/O manager configurations for `local` and `production` environments using [configuration](/concepts/configuration/configured) (specifically the configured API) and [resources](/concepts/resources).

This example is adapted from the [Transitioning data pipelines from development to production guide](/guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production):

```python file=/guides/dagster/development_to_production/repository/repository_v3.py startafter=start endbefore=end
# repository.py


@repository
def repo():
    resource_defs = {
        "local": {
            "snowflake_io_manager": snowflake_io_manager.configured(
                {
                    "account": "abc1234.us-east-1",
                    "user": {"env": "DEV_SNOWFLAKE_USER"},
                    "password": {"env": "DEV_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"},
                    "database": "LOCAL",
                    "schema": {"env": "DEV_SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA"},
                }
            ),
        },
        "production": {
            "snowflake_io_manager": snowflake_io_manager.configured(
                {
                    "account": "abc1234.us-east-1",
                    "user": "system@company.com",
                    "password": {"env": "SYSTEM_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"},
                    "database": "PRODUCTION",
                    "schema": "HACKER_NEWS",
                }
            ),
        },
    }
    deployment_name = os.getenv("DAGSTER_DEPLOYMENT", "local")

    return [
        *with_resources(
            [items, comments, stories], resource_defs=resource_defs[deployment_name]
        )
    ]
```

Let's review what's happening here:

- This code defines a Dagster [repository](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories) named `repo`
- Using `resource_defs`, we've created a list of resource definitions, named after our `local` and `production` environments, that are available to the repository. In this example, we're using a [Snowflake I/O manager](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-snowflake).
- For both `local` and `production`, we used the <PyObject object="configured" /> method on `snowflake_io_manager` to provide environment-specific run configuration. Note the differences in configuration between `local` and `production`, specifically where environment variables were used.
- Following the list of resources, we define the `deployment_name` variable, which determines the current executing environment. This variable defaults to `local`, ensuring that `DAGSTER_DEPLOYMENT=PRODUCTION` must be set to use the `production` configuration.
- Lastly, we use <PyObject object="with_resources" /> to:
  - Provide the resources to the assets in the repository
  - Parameterize usage of the resources based on the value of `DAGSTER_DEPLOYMENT`

### Example 2: Dagster Cloud Branch Deployments

<Note>This section is applicable only to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Adapted from the [Testing against production with Dagster Cloud Branch Deployments guide](/guides/dagster/branch_deployments), this example demonstrates how to determine the current deployment type at runtime - [Branch Deployment](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) or full deployment - without using resources or configuration.

Let's look at a function that determines the current deployment using the `DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable:

```python
def get_current_env():
  is_branch_depl = os.getenv("DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT") == "1"
  assert is_branch_depl != None  # env var must be set
  return "branch" if is_branch_depl else "prod"
```

This function checks the value of `DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT` and, if equal to `1`, returns a variable with the value of `branch`. This indicates that the current deployment is a Branch Deployment. Otherwise, the deployment is a full deployment and `is_branch_depl` will be returned with a value of `prod`.

Using this info, we can write code that executes differently when in a Branch Deployment or a full deployment.
