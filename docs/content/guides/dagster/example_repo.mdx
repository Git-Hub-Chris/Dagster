# Hacker News Example Repository

The [Hacker News example repo](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/hacker_news) takes advantage of a wide range of Dagster features, and can be useful as a point of reference for how we imagine structuring Dagster projects and using different APIs. At a high level, it consists of three pipelines, all centered around a (contrived) use case of downloading Hacker News user activity data, loading it into a database, and doing analysis on the aggregated data.

Beyond the dagster libraries that it demonstrates the use of (listed below), this example shows useful patterns for many Dagster concepts: schedules, sensors, IOManagers, modes, resources, and unit tests (to name a few).

As time goes on, this repository will be kept up to date, taking advantage of new Dagster features and interfaces. If you have anything you'd like to add, or like to see an example of, don't hesitate to reach out!
