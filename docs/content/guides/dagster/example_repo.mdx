# Hacker News Repository

When starting out with Dagster, it can be helpful to have an example repository that takes advantage of lots of Dagster features, as a base for your own repositories. This repo shows a set of example pipelines, complete with different modes, and can serve as a jumping off point for people that

## Integrations Used

- [dagster_dbt](/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt)
- dagster_aws(/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-aws)
- dagster_slack(/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-slack)
- dagster_pandas(/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-pandas)
- dagster_pyspark(/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-pyspark)

Ops, Graphs, and Jobs, are an experimental set of APIs that aim to simplify and give more accessible names to some of Dagster's core concepts. This guide describes how to migrate code that uses Pipelines, Modes, Presets, and Partition Sets to the new APIs.

A detailed API reference for the new APIs can be found [here](/_apidocs/experimental).

Migrating a pipeline to a graph does not require migrating all your other pipelines to graphs. Graphs, jobs, and pipelines can co-exist peacefully in Python.

In Dagit, graphs and jobs will be displayed as pipelines. You can also toggle Dagit to switch to a view that's better suited to the new APIs. Click the gear icon in the upper right corner, and then toggle "Experimental Core APIs (Job & Graph)". After flipping this toggle, Dagit will display a job for each mode in each pipeline.

## A simple pipeline

For simple pipelines, the new APIs just have different names. Here's a pipeline containing a single solid:
