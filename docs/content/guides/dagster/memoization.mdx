# Versioning and memoization <Experimental />

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/versioning_memoization" />

This example describes how to use Dagster's versioning and memoization features.

Dagster can use versions to determine whether or not it is necessary to re-execute a particular step. Given versions of the code from each op in a job, the system can infer whether an upcoming execution of a step will differ from previous executions by tagging op outputs with a version. This allows for the outputs of previous runs to be re-used. We call this process **memoized execution**.

---

## Quick start

You can enable memoization functionality by providing a <PyObject object="VersionStrategy"/> to your job. Dagster provides the <PyObject object="SourceHashVersionStrategy"/> as a top-level export.

```python file=/guides/dagster/versioning_memoization/memoization_enabled_job.py
from dagster import SourceHashVersionStrategy, job


@job(version_strategy=SourceHashVersionStrategy())
def the_job():
    ...
```

When memoization is enabled, the outputs of ops will be cached. Ops will only be re-run if:

- An upstream output's version changes
- The config to the op changes
- The version of a required resource changes
- The value returned by your VersionStrategy for that particular op changes. In the case of <PyObject object="SourceHashVersionStrategy"/>, this only occurs when the code within your ops and resources changes.

## How versioning works

The following diagram shows how an op output version is computed.

Notice how the version of an output depends on all upstream output versions. Because of this, output versions are computed in topological order.

This diagram describes the computation of the version of a resource.

Resource versions are also computed in topological order, as resources can depend on other resources.

## How memoization works

Memoization is enabled by using a _version strategy_ on your job, in tandem with <PyObject object="MemoizableIOManager"/>. In addition to the `handle_output` and `load_input` methods from the traditional <PyObject object="IOManager"/>, `MemoizableIOManager`s also implement a `has_output` method. This is intended to check whether an output already exists that matches specifications.

Before execution occurs, the Dagster system will determine a set of which steps actually need to run. If using memoization, Dagster will check whether all the outputs of a given step have already been memoized by calling the `has_output` method on the io manager for each output. If `has_output` returns `True` for all outputs, then the step will not run again.

Several of the persistent IO managers provided by Dagster are memoizable. This includes Dagster's default io manager, the <PyObject module="dagster_aws.s3" object="s3_pickle_io_manager"/> and the <PyObject object="fs_io_manager"/>.

## Writing a custom VersionStrategy

There will likely be cases where the default <PyObject object="SourceHashVersionStrategy"/> will not suffice. In these cases, it is advantageous to implement your own `VersionStrategy` to match your requirements.

Check out the implementation of <PyObject object="SourceHashVersionStrategy"/> as an example.

## Writing a custom MemoizableIOManager

If you are using a custom IO manager and want to make use of memoization functionality, then your custom IO manager must be memoizable. This means they must implement the `has_output` function. The <PyObject object="OutputContext" method="get_output_identifier" /> will provide a path which includes version information that you can both store and check outputs to. Check out our implementations of io managers for inspiration.

## Disabling memoization

Sometimes, you may want to run the whole job from scratch. Memoization can be disabled by setting the `MEMOIZED_RUN_TAG` to false on your job.
