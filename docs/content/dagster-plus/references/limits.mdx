# Dagster+ API Limits

Dagster+ enforces several API rate limits to smoothly distribute load. Deployments are limited to:

- 40,000 custom events per minute. This limit only applies to custom events; system events like the ones that drive orchestration or materialize assets are not subject to this limit.
- 35MB of events per minute. This limit applies to both custom events and system events.

Rate limited requests return a "429 - Too Many Requests" response. Dagster+ agents automatically retry these requests.

Switching from [Structured event logs](/concepts/logging#structured-event-logs) to [Raw compute logs](/concepts/logging#raw-event-logs) or reducing your custom log volume can help you stay within these limits.
