Insights is Dagster Cloud feature that provides visibility into historical usage and cost metrics such as run duration, credit usage and failures. This feature is available as a top level tab in the Dagster Cloud UI:

The Insights page shows a list of metrics in the left panel. For each metric the daily, weekly or monthly aggregated values are shown in a graph in the main panel. As of October 2023 the metrics are update once a day.

## External metrics

External metrics such as Snowflake credits spent can be integrated in the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster Cloud via an API.

### How to enable Snowflake and dbt with Insights

If you use dbt to materialize tables in Snowflake, you can use these instructions to integrate Snowflake metrics into the Insights UI.

#### Step 1 - Instrument your dbt asset definition

You need `dagster-cloud` version 1.5.1 or newer. Instrument the dagster `@dbt_assets` function with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights`.

This passes through all the underlying events and in addition emits an `AssetObservation` for each materialization. This observation contains the dbt invocation id and unique id that get recorded in the Dagster event log.

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import dbt_with_snowflake_insights
@dbt_assets(...)
def my_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    # Typically you have a `yield from dbt_resource.cli(...)`.
    # Wrap the original call with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights` as below.
    dbt_cli_invocation = dbt_resource.cli(["build"], context=context)
    yield from dbt_with_snowflake_insights(context, dbt_cli_invocation)
```

#### Step 2 - Update your dbt_project.yml

Add the following to your `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
query-comment:
  comment: "snowflake_dagster_dbt_v1_opaque_id[[[{{ node.unique_id }}:{{ invocation_id }}]]]"
  append: true
```

This adds a comment to each query recorded in the `query_history` table in Snowflake. The comment contains the dbt unique id and invocation id. Here `append: true` is important since Snowflake strips leading comments.

#### Step 3 - Create a metrics ingestion pipeline

Create a Dagster pipeline that joins asset observation events with the Snowflake query history and calls the Dagster Cloud ingestion API. This needs a Snowflake resource that can query `query_history`. You can use a pre-defined pipeline as below:

```python
from datetime import date
from dagster_snowflake import SnowflakeResource
from dagster import Definition, EnvVar

from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import (
    create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule,
)

snowflake_insights_definitions = create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule(
    date(2023, 10, 5),
    allow_partial_partitions=True,
    dry_run=False,
    snowflake_resource_key="snowflake_insights",
)

defs = Definitions(
  assets=[..., *snowflake_insights_definitions.assets],
  schedules=[..., snowflake_insights_deifnitions.schedule],
  resources={
    ...,
    "snowflake_insights": SnowflakeResource(
      account=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_ACCOUNT"),
      user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_USER"),
      password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_PASSWORD"),
    ),
	}
)
```

The `snowflake_resource_key` is a SnowflakeResource that has access to the `query_history` table. Once the pipeline runs, Snowflake credits should be visible in the Insights tab:
