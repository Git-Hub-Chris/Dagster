The Insights page shows a list of metrics in the left panel. For each metric the daily, weekly or monthly aggregated values are shown in a graph in the main panel. These metrics are updated available on a daily cadence. The following metrics are available:

- **Dagster credits**: Dagster credit cost associated with computing this object. Dagster credits are charged for every step that is run, and for every asset that is materialized.
- **Compute duration**: Time spent computing steps. For jobs which run steps in parallel, the compute duration may be longer than the wall clock time it takes for the run to complete.
- **Retry compute**: "Time spent computing steps, including time spent retrying failed steps. For jobs which run steps in parallel, the compute duration may be longer than the wall clock time it takes for the run to complete.
- **Step retries**: Number of times steps were retried when computing this object.
- **Observations**: Number of asset observations associated with computing this object.
- **Materializations**: Number of asset materializations associated with computing this object.
- **Step failures**: Number of times steps failed when computing this object. Note that steps which retry and succeed are not tallied in this metric.
- **Asset check warnings**: Number of asset checks that produced warnings.
- **Asset check errors**: Number of asset checks that produced errors.

## External metrics
