# Dagster Cloud Insights

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>. Request access using
  the&nbsp;
  <a href="https://dagster.slack.com/archives/C05V7GETFSQ">#dagster-insights</a>
  &nbsp;channel in the Dagster Slack.
</Note>

Using Dagster Cloud Insights, you can gain visibility into historical usage and cost metrics such as Dagster Cloud run duration, credit usage, and failures. You can also [integrate other external metrics](#integrating-external-metrics) into the Insights UI and [export metrics from Dagster Cloud](#exporting-metrics).

## Accessing Insights in the Dagster UI

To access this feature, click **Insights** in the top navigation bar in the UI:

The left navigation panel on this page contains a list of [available metrics](#available-metrics). For each metric, the daily, weekly, or monthly aggregated values are displayed in the graph.

These metrics are updated on a daily basis.
