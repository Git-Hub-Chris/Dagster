# Getting started with Dagster Cloud

Welcome to Dagster Cloud!

In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to get up and running with Dagster Cloud, including:

- Creating your Dagster Cloud account
- Selecting a deployment type
- Deploying your code
- Setting up CI/CD
- Setting up environment variables and secrets

Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Create a Dagster Cloud account and organization

If you don't already have a Dagster Cloud account, [sign up for one](https://dagster.cloud/signup) before continuing.

You'll also be asked to create a Dagster Cloud organization. When your organization is created, a single deployment, named `prod`, will also be created. This is called a [**full deployment**](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/managing-deployments). Full deployments are standalone environments, allowing you to operate independent instances of Dagster with separately managed permissions.

---

## Step 2: Select a deployment type

In this step, you'll select the type of deployment you want to use: **Serverless** or **Hybrid**.

In the following table, you'll find:

- **Type** - The name of the deployment type
- **How it works** - Summary of how the deployment type works
- **May be a good fit if...** - A high-level summary of when the deployment type may be a good fit

        Serverless Deployment is a fully-managed version of Dagster Cloud that

    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Hybrid</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        With a Hybrid Deployment, your Dagster code is executed in your
        infrastructure. The agent runs in your infrastructure, executes your
        code, and streams metadata about code execution over HTTPS back to
        Dagster Cloud. Refer to the{" "}
        <a href="/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid">
          Hybrid deployment documentation
        </a>{" "}
        for more info.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Dagster Cloud supports a handful of agents, each with its own prerequisites
        for setup. Refer to the <a href="/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents">
          Agent documentation
        </a> for more info.

</table>

Select the deployment type you want to use and [proceed to the next step](#step-3-deploy-your-code). **Note**: If you find your deployment type isn't right for you, it can be changed at any time.

---

## Step 3: Deploy your code

Now that you've set up your deployment, you'll need to tell Dagster Cloud the location of your Dagster code.

A code location specifies a single Python package or file that defines your Dagster code. Each Dagster Cloud deployment can include code from one or more code locations. Refer to the [Adding a code location guide](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations) for more info.

The steps for defining a code location vary depending on the **deployment type** you selected in the previous step:

<TabGroup>
  <TabItem name="Select deployment type">

Click the tab for your deployment type - **Serverless** or **Hybrid** - to view what's next.

  </TabItem>
	<TabItem name="Serverless">

For **Serverless deployments**, there are two ways to deploy your code to Dagster Cloud:

- **Adding a GitHub repository** - If you're a GitHub user, this is the easiest way to deploy your code.
- **Using the dagster-cloud CLI** - If you use a non-GitHub git provider or are developing locally, you can use our CLI to get started.

<TabGroup>
  <TabItem name="Add a GitHub repository">

1. Click **Connect to GitHub**.
2. Click **Choose account or organization** and sign into your GitHub account.
3. Select the account or organization where Dagster should be installed.
4. After the installation and authorization is complete, you'll be redirected back to Dagster Cloud.
5. After Dagster Cloud is connected, you'll be prompted to either:

   - **Clone the Dagster Cloud starter project** - This option clones the [dagster-cloud-template](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-template) repo, which already has Serverless Deployment and [Branch Deployments](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) configured.

     1. Enter a **Repository name**.
     2. Select a **Repository visibility**.
     3. Click **Clone and deploy.**

   - **Use an existing repo** - This option uses an existing repository in your GitHub account.
     1. Select a **repository**.
     2. Click **Deploy**.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-cicd).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="Use the CLI">
<Note>
  Using the <code>dagster-cloud</code> CLI requires a recent version of Python 3
  and Docker.
</Note>

To complete this step using the CLI, you can use your own Dagster code or the [`dagster-cloud-examples` code](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud/tree/main/dagster-cloud-examples). Our examples use the `dagster-cloud-examples` package.

1. To install the `dagster-cloud` CLI and the `dagster-cloud-examples` package, run:

   ```shell
   pip install dagster-cloud dagster-cloud-examples
   ```

2. Complete the setup:

   1. Complete the authentication step, including [creating a user token](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-user-agent-tokens#managing-user-tokens).

   2. **If using your own Dagster code**, add `dagster-cloud` as a dependency in `setup.py`. [Click here for an example](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud/blob/main/dagster-cloud-examples/setup.py).

3. Run the following to deploy your code to Dagster Cloud:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud serverless deploy \
         --location-name "<LOCATION_NAME>" \
         --package-name <PACKAGE_NAME> \
   ```

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-cicd).

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>
</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Hybrid">

To set up a Hybrid deployment and deploy your code, you need to:

1. Set up an agent
2. Add the code location in Dagster Cloud

**Step 3.1: Create a Hybrid agent**

1. The modal that displays will contain a pre-generated [agent token](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-user-agent-tokens) and info about the agents currently supported by Dagster Cloud.
2. Follow the steps for setting up and deploying your agent:

   - [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-new-vpc)
   - [Docker](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker)
   - [Kubernetes](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent)
   - [Local](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/local)

**Step 3.2: Add a Dagster Cloud code location**

1. In Dagster Cloud, click **Workspace**.

2. Click the **Add sample code location** button:

   <Image
   alt="Dagit Workspace Screen"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/getting-started/adding_code_location.png"
   width={1118}
   height={451}
   />

3. A pre-filled YAML editor with configuration will display.

4. Verify that the configuration is correct, then click **Add code location** to save the config.

The agent will attempt to load the your code. After the code is loaded, the new code location will show a **Loaded** status and a sample Dagster job will display in Dagster Cloud.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-cicd).

  </TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Step 4: Set up CI/CD

<Note>
  If you're using Serverless deployment <strong>and</strong> you used one of our
  templates to deploy your code, this step has already been completed for you!
  CI/CD comes pre-configured in our starter projects.
</Note>

Branch Deployments allow you to quickly and collaboratively develop your Dagster jobs. When a branch is created or updated in your Dagster repository, Branch Deployments will create a testing environment in the current Dagster Cloud deployment. For example, `prod`.

Check out the [Branch Deployment docs](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) for more info. If you skip this step now, you can always set it up later.

## Step 5: Set up environment variables and secrets

Set up environment variables and secrets.
