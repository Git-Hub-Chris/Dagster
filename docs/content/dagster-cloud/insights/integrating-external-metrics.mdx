# Integrating external metrics into Dagster Cloud Insights

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster Cloud via an API.

## Limitations

Before you start, note that:

- This is a Dagster Cloud Enterprise feature
- Up to two million individual data points may be added to Insights, per month
- External metrics data will only be retained for 90 days

---

## Supported integrations

Currently, Insights supports integrating Snowflake metrics.
