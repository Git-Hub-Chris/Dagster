# Managing users in Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Users in Dagster Cloud can be granted specific permissions for what they can and cannot do in your organization. Granularly assigning permissions to users ensures that the right people have appropriate access to what they require in Dagster Cloud, and no more.

In this guide, we'll cover how to add and remove users in your organization.

## Adding users

<Note>
  <strong>Organization Admin</strong> or <strong>Admin</strong> permissions are
  required to add users in Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

Before you start, note that:

- **If using Google for SSO**, users must be added in Dagster Cloud before they can log in.

- **If using a SAML-based solution like Okta**, users must be assigned to the Dagster app in the SSO portal to log in. By default, users will be granted Viewer permissions on each deployment. The default role can be adjusted by modifying the [`sso_default_role` deployment setting](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/deployment-settings-reference#sso-default-role).

1. Sign in to your Dagster Cloud account.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Cloud Settings**.
3. Click the **Users** tab.
4. In the **Enter an email...** field, enter the user's email address.
5. Click **Add user**. The user will be added to the list of users.
6. In the window that displays, select the appropriate [user role](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions) for each deployment. **Note**: For Admins, you can only set permissions for deployments where you're an Admin:
   1. Next to a deployment, click **Edit user role**.
   2. Select the user role for the deployment. This [user role](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions) will be used as the default for all code locations in the deployment.
   3. Click **Save**.
   4. **Enterprise only**: To set permissions for individual [code locations](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions#code-location-permissions) in a deployment:
      1. Click the toggle to the left of the deployment to open a list of code locations.
      2. Next to a code location, click **Edit user role**.
      3. Select the user role for the code location.
      4. Click **Save**.
7. Repeat step 6 for each deployment.
8. **Optional**: To change the user's permissions for branch deployments:
   1. Next to **All branch deployments**, click **Edit user role**.
   2. Select the user role to use for all branch deployments.
   3. Click **Save**.
9. Click **Done**.

## Removing users

<Note>
  <strong>Organization Admin</strong> permissions are required to remove users
  in Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

Removing a user removes them from the organization. **Note**: If using a SAML-based SSO solution like Okta, you'll also need to remove the user from the Identity Provider (IdP). Removing the user in Dagster Cloud doesn't remove them from the IdP.

1. Sign in to your Dagster Cloud account.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Cloud Settings**.
3. Click the **Users** tab.
4. Locate the user in the user list.
5. Click **Edit**.
6. Click **Remove user**.
7. When prompted, confirm the removal.
