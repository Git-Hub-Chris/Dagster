# Getting started with Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Welcome to Dagster Cloud!

Ready to get started? The steps for doing so vary a bit depending on your deployment type - check out the following sections for more info and links to resources.

## Serverless Deployments

[Serverless Deployment](/dagster-cloud/deployment/serverless) is a fully-managed version of Dagster Cloud that allows you to run your Dagster jobs without spinning up any infrastructure. While Serverless is the easiest way to get started with Dagster, this deployment type works best with jobs that aren't computationally expensive.

Check out the [Getting started with Serverless guide](/dagster-cloud/getting-started/getting-started-with-serverless-deployment) to get up and running.

## Hybrid Deployments

With a [Hybrid Deployment](/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid), your Dagster code is executed in your infrastructure and requires setting up an agent for use with Dagster Cloud. The agent runs in your infrastructure, executes your code, and streams metadata about code execution over HTTPS back to Dagster Cloud.

Check out the [Getting started with Hybrid guide](/dagster-cloud/getting-started/getting-started-with-hybrid-deployment) to get up and running.
