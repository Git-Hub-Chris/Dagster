# Getting started with Dagster Cloud

Welcome to Dagster Cloud!

In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to get up and running with Dagster Cloud, including:

- Creating your Dagster Cloud account
- Selecting a deployment type
- Deploying your code
- Setting up CI/CD
- Setting up environment variables and secrets

Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Create a Dagster Cloud account and organization

If you don't already have a Dagster Cloud account, [sign up for one](https://dagster.cloud/signup) before continuing.

You'll also be asked to create a Dagster Cloud organization. When your organization is created, a single deployment, named `prod`, will also be created. Refer to the [Managing deployments guide](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/managing-deployments) for more information about deployments in Dagster Cloud.

---

## Step 2: Select a deployment type

In this step, you'll select the type of deployment you want to use: **Serverless** or **Hybrid**.

Select the deployment type you want to use and [proceed to the next step](#step-3-deploy-your-code). **Note**: If you find your deployment type isn't right for you, it can be changed at any time.

---

## Step 3: Deploy your code

Now that you've selected a deployment type, the next step is to tell Dagster Cloud the location of your Dagster code. In addition to this, you'll set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). Once completed, [Branch Deployments](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/branch-deployments) and continuous code location deployments will be enabled for your Dagster project.

The steps for accomplishing this vary depending on the **deployment type** you selected in the previous step:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Select deployment type">

Click the tab for your deployment type - **Serverless** or **Hybrid** - to view what's next.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Serverless">

### Serverless

For **Serverless deployments**, there are two ways to deploy your code to Dagster Cloud:

- **Start from a template** - Use one of our quickstart templates to get up and running. All templates come with CI/CD already configured and will be cloned to a new GitHub repository.

- **Import an existing project** - Import an existing GitHub repository using our GitHub integration or the [dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-cli). **Note**: If using the GitHub integration, Dagster Cloud will automatically set up CI/CD for you.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Use a template">

**With GitHub**

1. Click **Select** to select a template.
2. Sign in to your GitHub account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster Cloud, define the following:
   - **Git scope** - Select the organization or account to create the new repository in.
   - **Repository Name** - Enter a name for the new repository.
   - Check the **Make git repository private** box to make the repository private.
4. When finished, click **Clone and deploy**.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

**With Gitlab**

1. Click **Select** to select a template.
2. Sign in to your Gitlab account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster Cloud, define the following:
   - **Namespace** - Select the group or account to create the new project in.
   - **Project** - Enter a name for the new project.
   - Check the **Make git project private** box to make the project private.
4. When finished, click **Clone and deploy**.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Import an existing project">

To import existing Dagster code, you can use Dagster's GitHub / Gitlab app or the dagster-cloud CLI.

**Using the GitHub integration**

Using the GitHub integration to import an existing GitHub repository also sets up CI/CD for you.

Before you get started, note that the repository must have a [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) in order for Dagster Cloud to deploy it. This file defines the [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) in your Dagster code.

If this file doesn't currently exist, create it in the root of your repository with the following code:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my_location_name # the name of the code location
    code_source:
      package_name: hackernews # the name of the python package associated with the code location
```

After you've committed the file to the repository, come back to Dagster Cloud to complete the import process:

1. Click the **Import an existing project** tab.
2. Sign in to your GitHub account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster Cloud, define the following:
   - **Git scope** - Select the organization or account that the repository is in.
   - **Repository** - Select the repository.
4. Click **Deploy**.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

**Using the Gitlab integration**

Using the Gitlab integration to import an existing Gitlab project also sets up CI/CD for you.

Before you get started, note that the project must have a [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) in order for Dagster Cloud to deploy it. This file defines the [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) in your Dagster code.

If this file doesn't currently exist, create it in the root of your repository with the following code:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my_location_name # the name of the code location
    code_source:
      package_name: hackernews # the name of the python package associated with the code location
```

After you've committed the file to the project, come back to Dagster Cloud to complete the import process:

1. Click the **Import an existing project** tab.
2. Sign in to your Gitlab account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster Cloud, define the following:
   - **Namespace** - Select the group or account that the project is in.
   - **Project** - Select the project.
4. Click **Deploy**.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

**Using the dagster-cloud CLI**

<Note>
  Using the dagster-cloud CLI requires a recent version of Python 3 and Docker.
</Note>

To complete this step using the CLI, you can use your own Dagster code or the [Dagster starter kit](https://github.com/dagster-io/quickstart-etl). The starter kit is a template with everything you need to get started using Serverless in Dagster Cloud, including CI/CD configuration and the required [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml).

- **If using the template**, [clone the repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/quickstart-etl) to your local environment.

- **If not using the template**, add `dagster-cloud` as a dependency in `setup.py`. \[Click here for an example]\(<https://github.com/dagster-io/quickstart-etl/blob/main/setup.py>. This is already done for you if using the starter kit.

After you've finished setting up your local project, move on to deploying using the CLI:

1. To install the dagster-cloud CLI, run:

   ```shell
   pip install dagster-cloud
   ```

2. Next, you'll need to authenticate to Dagster Cloud. Run the following command and follow the prompts to log in:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud config setup
   ```

3. After you've successfully authenticated, run the following to deploy your code to Dagster Cloud:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud serverless deploy \
         --location-name "<LOCATION_NAME>" \       # name of the code loation
         --package-name "<PACKAGE_NAME>" \           # name of the Python package associated with the code location
   ```

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>
</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Hybrid">

### Hybrid

To set up Hybrid deployment and deploy your code, you'll need to:

1. Set up an agent
2. Configure CI/CD for your project

For most Hybrid deployments - with the exception of those using a local agent - you'll need to create a Docker image containing your Dagster code and then add a code location to Dagster Cloud that references the image.

---

**Step 1: Create a Hybrid agent**

1. The dialog that displays will contain a pre-generated [agent token](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-user-agent-tokens) and details about the agents currently supported by Dagster Cloud.

   **Note**: Keep this token handy - you'll need it to set up CI/CD in the next step.

2. Follow the steps for setting up and deploying your agent:

   - [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-new-vpc)
   - [Docker](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker)
   - [Kubernetes](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent)
   - [Local](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/local)

The dialog will indicate when Dagster Cloud receives an agent heartbeat. Click **Continue**.

---

**Step 2: Configure CI/CD for your project**

Next, you'll configure CI/CD for your Dagster project. How this is accomplished depends on your CI/CD provider:

- **GitHub** - If using GitHub, you can use our GitHub Action workflow to set up CI/CD for your project.
- **Another CI/CD provider** - If you're not using GitHub, you can configure CI/CD using the dagster-cloud CLI.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="GitHub Actions">

To set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions, you can use your own Dagster code or the [Dagster Cloud Hybrid Quickstart](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart). The quickstart is a template with everything you need to get started using Hybrid deployment in Dagster Cloud.

- **If using the template**, [clone the repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart).

- **If not using the template**, copy the GitHub workflow files (`.github/workflows`) from the [Hybrid quickstart repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/tree/main/.github/workflows) and add them to your repository. This is already done for you if using the quickstart.

1. In the repository, set the necessary GitHub action secrets:

   - `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN` - The Dagster Cloud agent token from the previous section. Refer to the [agent tokens documentation](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-user-agent-tokens#managing-agent-tokens) for more info.

   Refer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for more info about GitHub Action secrets.

2. In `deploy-dagster-cloud.yml`, set the `DAGSTER_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` environment variable to your dagster.cloud organization name.

3. In `deploy-dagster-cloud.yml`, uncomment the step that is relevant to your Docker container registry. For example, if using DockerHub, you'd uncomment the `DockerHub` step in these files. Ensure you have set up the relevant secrets for building and uploading your Docker images.

When finished setting up the repository, navigate back to Dagster Cloud and move on to the next step.

---

The agent will attempt to load your code. After the code is loaded, the new code location will show a **Loaded** status and a sample Dagster job will display in Dagster Cloud.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Other CI/CD provider">

For continuous integration using a CI/CD provider other than GitHub, your system should use the `dagster-cloud ci` subcommand to deploy code locations to Dagster Cloud.

Ensure that you have created a `dagster_cloud.yaml` file as described in [Syncing the workspace](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/code-locations#managing-code-locations-using-the-dagster-cloud-cli#syncing-the-workspace). The following steps are typically implemented in the CI/CD workflow:

1. Set the build environment variables:

   - `DAGSTER_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` - the name of your organization in Dagster Cloud.
   - `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN` - a token created in Dagster Cloud.
   - `DAGSTER_BUILD_STATEDIR` - path to a blank or nonexistant temporary directory on the build machine. This directory is used to store local state during the build.

2. Run the configuration check:

       dagster-cloud ci check --project-dir=.

   This is an optional step but useful to validate the contents of your `dagster_cloud.yaml` and connection to Dagster Cloud.

3. Initialize the build session:

       dagster-cloud ci init --project-dir=.

   This reads the `dagster_cloud.yaml` configuration and initializes the `DAGSTER_BUILD_STATEDIR`.

4. Build and upload Docker images for you code locations.

   This step is specific to your Docker container registry and Docker build process. The only requirement is that the registry you upload to must match the registry specified in `dagster_cloud.yaml`. It is a good idea to use a unique image tag for each build.

   You can build one image per code location or a shared image for multiple code locations.

5. Update the build session with the Docker image tag. For each code location you want to deploy, run the following command passing the `IMAGE_TAG` used in the previous step:

       dagster-cloud ci set-build-output --location-name=code-location-a --image-tag=IMAGE_TAG

   This command does not deploy the code location but just updates the local state in `DAGSTER_BUILD_STATEDIR`.

6. Deploy to Dagster Cloud:

       dagster-cloud ci deploy

   This command updates the code locations in Dagster Cloud.

**Note**: Creating Branch Deployments using the CLI requires some additional steps. Refer to the [Branch Deployments with the dagster-cloud CLI guide](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/branch-deployments/using-branch-deployments) for more info.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Step 4: Set up environment variables and secrets

Congrats! At this point, your Dagster Cloud deployment should be up and running. To ensure the external services you use in your Dagster project work correctly, start setting up your [environment variables](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets). Using environment variables, you can securely pass in sensitive info like passwords, API tokens, etc.
