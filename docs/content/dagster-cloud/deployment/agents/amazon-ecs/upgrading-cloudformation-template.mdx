# Upgrading CloudFormation for an Amazon Elastic Container Services agent

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

In this guide, we'll show you how to upgrade an existing [Amazon Elastic Container Services (ECS) agent](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-existing-vpc)'s CloudFormation template.

**Note**: To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need [permissions in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to manage ECS agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html).

1. Sign in to your AWS console.

2. Navigate to the deployed stack and click **Update**.

3. Select **Replace current template**. You can specify a specific Dagster Cloud version or upgrade to the latest template.

   To use the latest template:

       https://s3.amazonaws.com/dagster.cloud/cloudformation/ecs-agent-vpc.yaml

   To specify a version:

       https://s3.amazonaws.com/dagster.cloud/cloudformation/ecs-agent-vpc-0-15-0.yaml

4. Proceed through the remaining steps in the wizard.

When finished, the agent will be re-deployed using the newest image and Dagster version.
