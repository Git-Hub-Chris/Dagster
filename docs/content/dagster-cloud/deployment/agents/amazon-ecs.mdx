# Dagster Cloud Amazon ECS agents

The Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) agent executes Dagster jobs as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Fargate ECS tasks. This agent is appropriate for scaled production deployments; ECS is a good choice for teams who have already standardized on ECS or who don't plan to run their own container orchestration infrastructure.

There are three ways you can create an Amazon ECS agent:

- [**In a new VPC, using our CloudFormation template**](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-new-vpc) - **Recommended**. This option spins up the ECS agent from scratch, creating a new VPC and ECS cluster for the agent to run in.
- [**In an existing VPC, using our CloudFormation template**](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-existing-vpc) - This option spins up the ECS agent stack in an existing VPC, using a new or existing ECS cluster.
- [**Manually provisioning the agent**](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/manually-provisioning-ecs-agent) - Manual provision is the most customizable option, but also the most advanced.

**Already used our CloudFormation template?** Refer to the [Upgrading CloudFormation for Amazon ECS guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/upgrading-cloudformation-template) for info about upgrading your ECS agent's template.
