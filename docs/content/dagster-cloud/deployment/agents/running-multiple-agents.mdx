# Running multiple agents <Experimental />

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Each Dagster Cloud instance deployment needs to have at least one agent running. Since the agent is lightweight and can tolerate short downtimes (e.g. during an upgrade), a single agent is adequate for most use cases.

If you want to distribute runs across multiple Kubernetes clusters, ECS clusters, EC2 instances, or other environments, you can run multiple agents. For example, one in each cluster, instance, etc.

It's recommended to only use multiple agents of the same type (e.g. multiple Kubernetes agents). Submitting runs to a specific agent isn't currently supported.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **dagster-cloud version 0.13.0 or later for both agents and job code.**
- **To use a Kubernetes, Docker, or local agent.** These agent types can support running multiple agents. Additionally, note that:

  - **Kubernetes agents must run in their own namespace or container.** Running multiple agents within a single namespace isn't currently supported.
  - **Docker agents must run in containers orchestrated by separate Docker daemons** (e.g. on a separate host machine). Running multiple agents on one Docker daemon isn't currently supported.

---

## Step 1: Set up the agent

Follow the setup guide for your agent:

- [Docker](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker)
- [Kubernetes](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent)
- [Local](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/local)

After the agent is up and running, move on to the next step.

## Step 2: Enable the agent_replicas setting

In this step, you'll enable the `agent_replicas` option to turn on running multiple agents. You can also choose to label the agent, making it easily identifiable on Dagster Cloud's **Status** page.

Follow the instructions for your agent:

<details>
  <summary><strong>DOCKER AGENTS</strong></summary>

**Docker agents must run in containers orchestrated by separate Docker daemons** (e.g. on a separate host machine). Running multiple agents on one Docker daemon isn't currently supported.

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
agent_replicas:
  enabled: true

dagster_cloud_api:
  # <your other config>
  agent_label: "My agent" # optional
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>KUBERNETES AGENTS</strong></summary>

**Kubernetes agents must run in their own namespace or container.** Running multiple agents within a single namespace isn't currently supported.

Add the following options to your Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set agentReplicas.enabled=true \
    --set dagsterCloud.agentLabel="My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

Or if you're using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
agentReplicas:
  enabled: true

dagsterCloud:
  agentLabel: "My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>LOCAL AGENTS</strong></summary>

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
agent_replicas:
  enabled: true

dagster_cloud_api:
  # <your other config>
  agent_label: "My agent" # optional
```

</details>
