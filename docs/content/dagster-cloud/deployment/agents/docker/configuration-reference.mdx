## Environment variables and secrets

Using the `container_context.docker.env_vars` property, you can include environment variables and secrets in the Docker container associated with a specific code location. For example:

```yaml
## dagster_cloud.yaml

container_context:
  docker:
    env_vars:
      - DATABASE_NAME
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=hooli_testing
```

The `container_context.docker.env_vars` property is a list, where each item can be either `KEY` or `KEY=VALUE`. If only `KEY` is specified, the value will be pulled from the local environment.

Refer to the following guides for more info about environment variables:
