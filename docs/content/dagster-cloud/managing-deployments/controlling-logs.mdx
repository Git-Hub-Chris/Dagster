# Managing compute logs and error messages in Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

In this guide, we'll cover how to adjust where Dagster Cloud compute logs are stored and manage masking of error messages in the Dagster Cloud UI.

By default, Dagster Cloud ingests [structured event logs and compute logs](/concepts/logging#log-types) from runs and surfaces error messages from [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) in the UI.

Depending on your organization's needs, you may want to retain these logs in your own infrastructure or mask error message contents.

## Modifying compute log storage

Dagster's compute logs are handled by the configured [`ComputeLogManager`](/\_apidocs/internals#dagster.\_core.storage.compute_log_manager.ComputeLogManager). By default, Dagster Cloud utilizes the `CloudComputeLogManager` which stores logs in a Dagster Cloud managed S3 bucket, but you can customize this behavior to store logs in a destination of your choice.

### Writing to your own S3 bucket

If using the Kubernetes agent, you can instead forward logs to your own S3 bucket by using the [`S3ComputeLogManager`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-aws#dagster_aws.s3.S3ComputeLogManager).

You can configure the `S3ComputeLogManager` in your [`dagster.yaml` file](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/customizing-configuration):

```yaml
compute_logs:
  module: dagster_aws.s3.compute_log_manager
  class: S3ComputeLogManager
  config:
    show_url_only: true
    bucket: your-compute-log-storage-bucket
    region: your-bucket-region
```

If you are using Helm to deploy the Kubernetes agent, you can provide the following configuration in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
computeLogs:
  enabled: true
  custom:
    module: dagster_aws.s3.compute_log_manager
    class: S3ComputeLogManager
    config:
      show_url_only: true
      bucket: your-compute-log-storage-bucket
      region: your-bucket-region
```

### Disabling compute log upload

If your organization has its own logging solution which ingests `stdout` and `stderr` from your compute environment, you may want to disable compute log upload entirely. You can do this with the [`NoOpComputeLogManager`](/\_apidocs/internals#dagster.\_core.storage.noop_compute_log_manager.NoOpComputeLogManager).

You can configure the `NoOpComputeLogManager` in your [`dagster.yaml` file](https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/customizing-configuration):

```yaml
compute_logs:
  module: dagster.core.storage.noop_compute_log_manager
  class: NoOpComputeLogManager
```

If you are using Helm to deploy thew Kubernetes agent, the `enabled` flag lets you easily disable compute log upload:

```yaml
computeLogs:
  enabled: false
```

### Other compute log storage options

For a full list of available compute log storage options, refer to the [Compute log storage docs](/deployment/dagster-instance#compute-log-storage).

## Masking error messages

By default, Dagster Cloud surfaces error messages from your code locations in the Dagster Cloud UI, including when runs fail, when sensors or schedules throw an exception, or when your code locations fail to load. You can mask these error messages in the case that their contents are sensitive.

In order to mask error messages in a Dagster Cloud Deployment, you can set the environment variable `DAGSTER_REDACT_USER_CODE_ERRORS` equal to `1` using the [Dagster Cloud Environment Variables](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets) UI:

src="/images/dagster-cloud/logs-error-messages/configure-redact-env-var.png"
width={644}
height={407}
/>

Once set, error messages from your code locations will be masked in the UI. A unique error ID will be generated, which you can use to look up the error message in your own logs.
