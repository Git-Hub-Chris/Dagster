# Dagster Cloud alerts

<ApplicableDagsterProduct />

Using Dagster Cloud's built-in alerting system, you can stay in the loop on the events occurring in your deployment. Dagster Cloud alerts integrate with several popular services, allowing you to deliver notifications when and where they're most needed.

---

## How it works

Alerts are created using **alert policies**. An alert policy defines [the conditions that will trigger an alert](#alert-policy-types) and [how the alert will be sent](#supported-notification-services). For example, you can create a policy that sends an alert to a Slack channel when any asset in a specific asset group fails to materialize.

Alert policies are configured on a **per-deployment basis**. This means, for example, that asset alerts configured in a `prod` deployment are only applicable to assets in that deployment.

### Alert policy types

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "25%",
        }}
      >
        Policy type
      </th>
      <th>How it works</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Asset alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers on asset materialization failure or success, as well as asset
        check error, warn, passed, or failure to execute.
        <br />
        <br />
        An asset group or asset key can be provided, which limits notifications to
        fire only if the asset group or asset key matches the materialized asset.
        In the case of checks, notifications will only be sent if the asset group/key
        to which the check is attached matches. <strong>Note:</strong> Asset based
        alert policies are still experimental and may be subject to change.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Run alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers on job run success or failure; may optionally include a set of
        configured tags. If an alert policy has no configured tags, all jobs
        will be eligible for that alert. Otherwise, only jobs that contain all
        the tags for a given alert policy are eligible for that alert.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Schedule/Sensor alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers when a schedule or sensor tick failure occurs for any schedule
        or sensor in the deployment. <strong>Note</strong>: Alerts are sent only
        when the schedule/sensor changes from <strong>success</strong> to{" "}
        <strong>failure</strong>, so subsequent failures won't trigger new
        alerts.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Code location error alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Triggers when a code location fails to load due to an error.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Agent downtime alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers when a Hybrid agent hasn't heartbeated within the last five
        minutes. Available for{" "}
        <a href="/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid">Hybrid deployments</a> only.

### Creating alert policies

1. Sign in to your Dagster Cloud account.

2. In the top navigation, click **Deployment**.

3. Click the **Alerts** tab.

4. Click **+ Create alert policy**.

5. In the **Create alert policy** window, select an [alert type](#alert-policy-types) and enter a name and description for the alert.

6. **If creating an asset or run alert**, fill in the following:

   <details>
     <summary>
       <strong>Asset alert policies</strong>
     </summary>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <strong>Target</strong> - Select the assets that the alert targets:
         <ul>
           <li>
             <strong>All assets</strong> - All assets in the deployment
           </li>
           <li>
             <strong>Group</strong> - All assets in a specific asset group in
             the deployment
           </li>
           <li>
             <strong>Asset key</strong> - A specific asset key in the deployment
           </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>Events</strong> - Select the event(s) that should trigger the
         alert. For example: asset materialization failure, asset check passed.
       </li>
     </ul>
   </details>

   <details>
     <summary>
       <strong>Run alert policies</strong>
     </summary>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <strong>Tags</strong> - Add tag(s) for the alert policy. Jobs with
         these tags will trigger the alert. For example:{" "}
         <code>level:critical</code> or <code>team:sales</code>
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>Events</strong> - Select whether the alert should trigger on
         job success, failure, or both
       </li>
     </ul>
   </details>

7. In the **Notification service** section, select how the alert will be delivered. Refer to the [Supported notification services](#supported-notification-services) section for information about setting up these services.

   **Note**: If creating an asset alert, an additional **Email asset owners (experimental)** option will be available.

8. When finished, click **Save policy**.

### Editing alert policies

To edit an existing alert policy, click the **Edit** button next to the policy.

### Enabling and disabling alert policies

To enable or disable an alert, use the toggle on the left side of the alert policy.

### Deleting alert policies

To delete an alert policy, click the **Delete** button next to the policy. When prompted, confirm the deletion.

## Managing alert policies with the dagster-cloud CLI

When creating an alert policy using the CLI, only certain `event_types` can be specified together. You can specify multiple job run-based event types together (`JOB_SUCCESS`, `JOB_FAILURE`), or a tick-based event type (`TICK_FAILURE`), but attempting to mix these will result in an error.

With the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-cli), you can:

- [Set a full deployment's policies](#setting-a-full-deployments-policies)
- [View a full deployment's policies](#viewing-a-full-deployments-policies)

### Setting a full deployment's policies

A list of alert policies can be defined in a single YAML file. After declaring your policies, set them for the deployment using the following command:

```bash
dagster-cloud deployment alert-policies sync -a <ALERT_POLICIES_PATH>
```

### Viewing a full deployment's policies

List the policies currently configured on the deployment by running:

```bash
dagster-cloud deployment alert-policies list
```
