# Logging

Dagster supports a variety of built-in logging options, as well as the ability to extend and customize them. By default, Dagster automatically tracks and captures all execution events, such as those during an asset materialization. During these events, logs like the following are generated:

```bash
12:40:05 - DEBUG - RUN_START - Started execution of run for "__ASSET_JOB_0".
12:40:05 - DEBUG - ENGINE_EVENT - Executing steps using multiprocess executor: parent process (pid: 86387)
12:40:05 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - STEP_WORKER_STARTING - Launching subprocess for "taxi_zones_file".
12:40:07 - DEBUG - STEP_WORKER_STARTED - Executing step "taxi_zones_file" in subprocess.
12:40:07 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - RESOURCE_INIT_S TARTED - Starting initialization of resources [io_manager].
12:40:07 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - RESOURCE_INIT_SUCCESS - Finished initialization of resources [io_manager].
12:40:07 - DEBUG - LOGS_CAPTURED - Started capturing logs in process (pid: 86390).
12:40:07 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - STEP_START - Started execution of step "taxi_zones_file".
12:40:09 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - STEP_OUTPUT - Yielded output "result" of type "Any". (Type check passed).
12:40:09 - DEBUG - __ASSET_JOB_0 - taxi_zones_file - Writing file at: /Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-examples/project-dagster-university/tmpfxsoltsc/storage/taxi_zones_file using PickledObjectFilesystemIOManager...
12:40:09 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - ASSET_MATERIALIZATION - Materialized value taxi_zones_file.
12:40:09 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - HANDLED_OUTPUT - Handled output "result" using IO manager "io_manager"
12:40:09 - DEBUG - taxi_zones_file - STEP_SUCCESS - Finished execution of step "taxi_zones_file" in 1.17s.
12:40:09 - DEBUG - ENGINE_EVENT - Multiprocess executor: parent process exiting after 4.38s (pid: 86387)
12:40:09 - DEBUG - RUN_SUCCESS - Finished execution of run for "__ASSET_JOB_0".
```

These logs can be exported to a local file or viewed in the [Dagster UI](#logs-in-the-dagster-ui).

## Uses

To utilize logging in Dagster, you can:

- [Extend and customize Dagster's built-in loggers](#built-in-loggers)
- [Use Python's logging module](#python-logging)
- [View and download logs in the Dagster UI](#dagster-ui)

### Built-in loggers

Dagster's [built-in loggers](/concepts/logging/loggers):

- Support all levels of Python logs, such as `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, etc.
- Can be configured to capture only specified levels, such as `ERROR`
- Can include manually-defined messages produced inside certain Dagster definitions like assets, ops, and sensors

**Loggers can also be customized**. Refer to the [Customizing loggers guide](/concepts/logging/custom-loggers) for more information and examples.

### Python logging

In addition to built-in loggers, Dagster is also compatible with [Python's logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

Python logs can be used to augment Dagster's default logs and configured to display in the UI. Other options, such as custom handlers and formatters, can be configured in your project's `dagster.yaml`.

Refer to the [Python logging guide](/concepts/logging/python-logging) for more information and examples.
