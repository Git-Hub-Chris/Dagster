A code location is a collection of Dagster definitions loadable and accessible by Dagster's tools, such as the CLI, Dagit, and Dagster Cloud. A code location comprises:

- A reference to a Python module or package that has an instance of <PyObject object="Definitions" /> in a top-level variable
- A Python environment that can successfully load that module or package

Definitions within a code location have a common namespace and must have unique names. This allows them to be grouped and organized by code location in tools.

A single deployment can have one or multiple code locations.

<Note>
  Before the introduction of the <PyObject object="Definitions" />
  API, definitions were grouped into repositories, and there could be many repostories
  in a particular code location. Refer to the <a href="/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories">
    Repositories documentation
  </a> for info on this previous API and mental model.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject object="Definitions" /> | The object that contains all the definitions defined within a code location. Definitions include assets, jobs, resources, schedules, and sensors. |

## Defining code locations

To define a code location, create a top-level variable that contains a <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object in a Python module. For example:

```python
# my_file.py

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[dbt_customers_asset, dbt_orders_asset],
    schedules=[bi_weekly_schedule],
    sensors=[new_data_sensor],
    resources=dbt_resource
)
```

Definitions can be included in a Python file like `my_file.py` or an installed Python package. If using the latter, the <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object should be defined in the package's top-level `__init__.py` file.

## Deploying and loading code locations

- [Local development](#local-development)
- [Cloud deployment](#cloud-deployment)
- [Open source deployment](#open-source-deployment)

### Local development

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="From a file">

Dagit and other Dagster tools can load a file directly as a code location. In the following example, we used the `-f` argument to supply the name of the file to `dagit`:

```shell
dagit -f my_file.py
```

This command loads the definitions in `my_file.py` as a code location in the same Python environment where Dagit resides.

You can also include multiple files at a time, which Dagit will load as individual code locations:

```shell
dagit -f my_file.py -f my_second_file.py
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="From an installed package">

Dagit and other Dagster tools can also load installed Python packages as code locations. When this approach is used, Dagster loads the definitions defined at the top-level of the package, in variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object of its root `__init__.py` file. As this style of development eliminates an entire class of Python import errors, we strongly recommend it for Dagster projects deployed to production.

In the following example, we used the `-m` argument to supply the name of the package to Dagit:

```shell
dagit -m your_package_name
```

This command loads the definitions in the variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in the named package - defined as the root `__init__.py` file - in the same virtual environment as Dagit.

**Note**: Before getting started, install dependencies as an editable install by running:

```shell
pip install -e
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Without command line arguments">

To load definitions without supplying command line arguments, you can use the `pyproject.toml` file. This file, included in all Dagster example projects, contains a `tool.dagster` section with a `python_package` variable:

```shell
[tool.dagster]
python_package = "your_package_name"  ## name of project's Python package
```

When defined, you can run this in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file:

```shell
dagit
```

Instead of this:

```shell
dagit -m your_package_name
```

### Cloud deployment

The `dagster_cloud.yaml` file is used to create and deploy code locations for Cloud deployments. For example:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my-code-location
    code_source: # provide one of python_file, package_name, module_name
      python_file: my_file.py # load code location from a Python file
      package_name: my_package_name # load code location from a Python package
      module_name: my_module_name # load code location from a Python module
```

Refer to the [TODO]() for more info and examples.

### Open source deployment

The `workspace.yaml` file is used to load code locations for open source (OSS) deployments. This file specifies how to load a collection of code locations and is typically used in advanced use cases. Refer to the [Open source deployment guides](/deployment/guides) for more info.
