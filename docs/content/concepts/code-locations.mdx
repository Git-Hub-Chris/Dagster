# Code locations

<Note>
  Before the introduction of the <PyObject object="Definitions" />
  API, definitions were grouped into repositories, and there could be many repostories
  in a particular code location. Refer to the <a href="/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories">
    Repositories documentation
  </a> for info on this previous API and mental model.
</Note>

A code location is a collection of Dagster definitions loadable and accessible by Dagster's tools, such as the CLI, Dagit, and Dagster Cloud. A code location comprises:

- A reference to a Python module that has an instance of <PyObject object="Definitions" /> in a top-level variable
- A Python environment that can successfully load that module

Definitions within a code location have a common namespace and must have unique names. This allows them to be grouped and organized by code location in tools.

A single deployment can have one or multiple code locations.

Code locations are loaded in a different process and communicate with Dagster system processes over an RPC mechanism. This architecture provides several advantages:

- When there is an update to user code, Dagit can pick up the change without a restart.
- You can use multiple code locations to organize jobs, but still work on all of your code locations using a single instance of Dagit.
- The Dagit process can run in a separate Python environment from user code so job dependencies don't need to be installed into the Dagit environment.
- Each code location can be sourced from a separate Python environment, so teams can manage their dependencies (or even their Python versions) separately.

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject object="Definitions" /> | The object that contains all the definitions defined within a code location. Definitions include assets, jobs, resources, schedules, and sensors. |

---

## Defining code locations

To define a code location, create a top-level variable that contains a <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object in a Python module. For example:

```python
# my_file.py

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[dbt_customers_asset, dbt_orders_asset],
    schedules=[bi_weekly_schedule],
    sensors=[new_data_sensor],
    resources=dbt_resource
)
```

Definitions can be included in a Python file like `my_file.py` or a Python module. If using the latter, the <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object should be defined in the module's top-level `__init__.py` file.

## Deploying and loading code locations

- [Local development](#local-development)
- [Cloud deployment](#cloud-deployment)
- [Open source deployment](#open-source-deployment)

### Local development

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="From a file">

Dagster can load a file directly as a code location. In the following example, we used the `-f` argument to supply the name of the file to `dagster dev`:

```shell
dagster dev -f my_file.py
```

This command loads the definitions in `my_file.py` as a code location in the current Python environment.

You can also include multiple files at a time, which Dagster will load as individual code locations:

```shell
dagster dev -f my_file.py -f my_second_file.py
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="From a module">

Dagster can also load Python modules as code locations. When this approach is used, Dagster loads the definitions defined at the top-level of the module, in a variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object of its root `__init__.py` file. As this style of development eliminates an entire class of Python import errors, we strongly recommend it for Dagster projects deployed to production.

In the following example, we used the `-m` argument to supply the name of the module to Dagster:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name
```

This command loads the definitions in the variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in the named module - defined as the root `__init__.py` file - in the current Python environment.

**Note**: Before getting started, install dependencies as an editable install by running:

```shell
pip install -e path/to/your/module_name
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Without command line arguments">

To load definitions without supplying command line arguments, you can use the `pyproject.toml` file. This file, included in all Dagster example projects, contains a `tool.dagster` section with a `module_name` variable:

```shell
[tool.dagster]
module_name = "your_module_name"  ## name of project's Python module
```

When defined, you can run this in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file:

```shell
dagster dev
```

Instead of this:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name
```

### Cloud deployment

The `dagster_cloud.yaml` file is used to create and deploy code locations for Cloud deployments. Each code location entry in this file has a `code_source` property, which is used to specify how a code location is sourced. Code locations can be sourced from a Python file or module:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Using a Python file">

To load a code location from a Python file, use the `python_file` property in your `dagster_cloud.yaml`:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my-code-location
    code_source:
      python_file: my_file.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using a Python module">

To load a code location from a Python module, use the `module_name` property in your `dagster_cloud.yaml`:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my-code-location
    code_source:
      module_name: my_module_name
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Open source deployment

The `workspace.yaml` file is used to load code locations for open source (OSS) deployments. This file specifies how to load a collection of code locations and is typically used in advanced use cases. Refer to the [Open source deployment guides](/deployment/guides) for more info.

## Definitions versus repositories

If you used <PyObject object="repository" decorator /> in previous Dagster versions, you might be interested in how `Definitions` and repositories differ. Check out the following table for a high-level comparison:
