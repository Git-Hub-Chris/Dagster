# Code Locations

- This guide refers to code locations when paired with the `Definitions` API.

A code location is set of dagster definitions loadable and accessible by
Dagster's tools, such as the CLI, Dagit, and Dagster Cloud. A code location comprises:

* A reference a python module that has an instance of `Definitions` at the "defs" variable. We
will refer to that as the "entry point".
* A Python environment that can successfully load the entry point.

Definitions within a code location have a common namespace and must have
unique names. This allows them to be grouped and organized by code location
in tools.

Before the introduction of the `Definitions` UI, definitions were grouped into
repositories, and there could be many repostories in a particular code location. See
LINK for this previous mental model.

<!-- Introduction
	Make sure to include:

	- What the concept is
	- What it does
	- When to use it
	- How it ties into a Dagster project overall

	For example: https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops#ops
	Ops includes the what, when, why, and a nifty diagram. Diagrams are huge for users.

## Creating/Applying/Using [CONCEPT]

<!-- See example: https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops#defining-an-op

	This section outlines the 'how' part of applying the concept in code
	Currently our docs go between the basics and some more complex use cases, but
	I'd opt for going simple here and getting more complex in the Examples section

	Additionally, if this concept will be surfaced in Dagit, consider covering that. Ex: Describe
	how to navigate to viewing the relevant page in Dagit.
-->

---

## Examples

<!-- Common use cases and other more complex examples, each separated by a heading.
	Examples should also include an explanation of what the code is doing / why
	it's done this way. Link to other docs where pertinent.

### Heading-for-this-example

[description]

```python file=
```

[code explanation]

## Troubleshooting

<!-- Common issues or error messages specific to the concept.

	See example: https://docs.dagster.io/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets#troubleshooting
	While not a concept page, this guide ^ demonstrates how to interpret errors + resolve issues

	The table used in that guide:
<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "30%",
        }}
      >
        Error
      </th>
      <th>Description and resolution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>[ERROR]</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Description of the error and how to resolve it
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

	Headings can be used if an error isn't surfaced, or if a table will make readability difficult. Ex:

### Brief-description-of-issue

Describe when/why this happens and how to fix it. Include code examples if needed.
