# Asset Observations

An asset observation is an event that records metadata about a given asset. Unlike asset materializations, asset observations do not signify that an asset has been mutated.

## Relevant APIs

| Name                                   | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> | Dagster event indicating that an asset's metadata has been recorded. |
| <PyObject object="AssetKey" />         | A unique identifier for a particular external asset.                 |

## Overview

<PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> events are used record metadata in Dagster
about a given asset. Asset observation events can be yielded at runtime within ops
and assets. An asset must be defined using the <PyObject
object="asset"
decorator
/> decorator or have existing materializations in order for its observations to be
displayed.

## Yielding an AssetObservation from an Op

To make Dagster aware that we have recorded metadata about an asset, we can yield an <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> event:

```python file=/concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_observation_asset_marker_0 endbefore=end_observation_asset_marker_0
from dagster import AssetObservation


@op
def observation_op():
    df = read_df()
    yield AssetObservation(asset_key="observation_asset", metadata={"num_rows": len(df)})
    yield Output(5)
```

We should now see an observation event in the event log when we execute this asset.

### Attaching Metadata to an AssetObservation

There are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with an observation event, all through the <PyObject object="MetadataEntry" /> class. Each observation event optionally takes a dictionary of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log and the [Asset Details](/concepts/dagit/dagit#asset-details) page. Check our API docs for <PyObject object="MetadataEntry" /> for more details on the types of event metadata available.

```python file=concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_observation_asset_marker_2 endbefore=end_observation_asset_marker_2
from dagster import op, AssetObservation, Output, EventMetadata


@op
def observes_dataset_op():
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    yield AssetObservation(
        asset_key="my_dataset",
        metadata={
            "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
            "path": EventMetadata.path(remote_storage_path),
            "dashboard_url": EventMetadata.url("http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"),
            "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
        },
    )
    yield AssetMaterialization(asset_key="my_dataset")
    yield Output(remote_storage_path)
```

In the [Asset Details](/concepts/dagit/dagit#asset-details) page, we can see observations in the Asset Activity table.

### Specifying a partition for an AssetObservation

If you are observing a single slice of an asset (e.g. a single day's worth of data on a larger table), rather than mutating or creating it entirely, you can indicate this to Dagster by including the `partition` argument on the object.

```python file=/concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_partitioned_asset_observation endbefore=end_partitioned_asset_observation
from dagster import op, AssetMaterialization, Output


@op(config_schema={"date": str})
def partitioned_dataset_op(context):
    partition_date = context.op_config["date"]
    df = read_df_for_date(partition_date)
    yield AssetObservation(asset_key="my_partitioned_dataset", partition=partition_date)
    yield Output(df)
```
