# Alerts in Dagster+

After you've set up [asset checks](/concepts/assets/asset-checks/define-execute-asset-checks) to verify the quality of your data, you can create alert policies to notify you when data quality issues arise.

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up dagster+ [alert policies](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts) that trigger based on asset check results.

## Defining an alert policy

In Dagster+, an alert policy is a set of rules that define when to send notifications, and where to send them.

Specifically for asset checks, alert policies provide the following filtering options:

- Alert on the specific asset key(s) or asset group(s) which are relevant to you.
- Alert on the severity level of the asset check failure (WARN, ERROR, or execution failure).

Notifications can be configured to send to various popular services, such as Slack, PagerDuty, and email. A complete list of available integrations can be found [here](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts#supported-notification-services).

To become more familiar with the various ways alert policies can be set up beyond asset checks, see the guide on [managing alert policies](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-in-ui).

<TabItem name="In the UI">

1. Navigate to the **Deployments** in the top navigation
2. Click the **Alerts** tab.
3. Click **+Create alert policy**.
4. Select the **Asset** alert policy type in the **Create alert policy** window.
5. Select an asset (or set of assets) to target with the alert policy. You can target all assets, a specific asset key, or an asset group.
6. Check the box for **Failed (WARN)** or **Failed (ERROR)** severity, depending on the severity set for freshness check failure.
7. Select a [notification service](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts#supported-notification-services), provide the necessary information, and save the alert policy.

<TabItem name="Via the CLI/config">

If you prefer to work in code, you can define an asset check-based alert policy in a YAML configuration file and use the `dagster-cloud` CLI to set the policy for the deployment. **Note**: Asset check-based policies also target freshness checks.

```yaml
alert_policies:
  - name: "daily_rollup_warn_checks"
    description: "Alert on WARN check failures for daily rollup table"
    target:
      asset_key: "daily_rollup"
    severity: "WARN"
    notification_config:
      email:
        email_addresses:
          - "nelson.bighetti@hooli.com"
          - "gavin.belson@hooli.com"
```

Refer to the [Managing alerts using the dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-cli#how-it-works) for more information.
