# Asset jobs

[Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) are the main unit for executing and monitoring Software-defined assets in Dagster. An asset job materializes a selection of [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets). It can be launched in a few different ways:

- Manually from the Dagster UI
- At fixed intervals, by [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules)
- When external changes occur, using [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors)

| <PyObject object="define_asset_job" /> | A function for defining a job from a selection of assets. |

## Creating asset jobs

Asset jobs materialize a fixed set of assets each time they run. Additionally, multiple jobs can target overlapping sets of assets:

```python file=/concepts/assets/build_job.py startafter=start_job_only_marker endbefore=end_job_only_marker
from dagster import Definitions, asset, define_asset_job


@asset
def asset1():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset
def asset2(asset1):
    return asset1 + [4]


all_assets_job = define_asset_job(name="all_assets_job")
asset1_job = define_asset_job(name="asset1_job", selection="asset1")

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[asset1, asset2],
    jobs=[all_assets_job, asset1_job],
)
```

The topology of an asset-based job is based on the [assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and their dependencies.

---

## Making asset jobs available to Dagster tools

You make asset jobs available to the UI, GraphQL, and the command line by including them in a <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object at the top level of a Python module or file. The tool loads that module as a code location. If you include schedules or sensors, the [code location](/concepts/code-locations) will automatically include jobs that those schedules or sensors target.

```python file=/concepts/assets/jobs_to_definitions.py
from dagster import Definitions, asset, define_asset_job


@asset
def number_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


number_asset_job = define_asset_job(name="number_asset_job", selection="number_asset")

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[number_asset],
    jobs=[number_asset_job],
)
```

---

## Testing asset jobs

Dagster has built-in support for testing, including separating business logic from environments and setting explicit expectations on uncontrollable inputs. Refer to the [Testing guide](/concepts/testing) for more info and examples.

---

## Executing asset jobs

You can run an asset job in a variety of ways:

- In the Python process where it's defined
- Via the command line
- Via the GraphQL API
- In [the UI](/concepts/webserver/ui). The UI centers on jobs, making it a one-stop shop - you can manually kick off runs for a job and view all historical runs.
