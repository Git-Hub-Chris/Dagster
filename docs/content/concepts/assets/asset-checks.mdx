# Asset checks (Experimental)

Dagster allows you to define and execute data quality checks on your [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets). Each asset check verifies some property of a data asset, e.g. that there are no null values in a particular column.

When viewing an asset in Dagster’s UI, you can see all of its checks, and whether they’ve passed, failed, or haven’t run.

## Benefits

Using asset checks provides the following benefits:

## Uses

With asset checks, you can:

- Guard against inaccurate and stale data by checking for quality and freshness
- Execute checks using the Dagster UI or schedules/sensors that run jobs with assets and checks
- Use severity levels and metadata to include actionable details about check results in the UI
- [Create alerts based on asset check results](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/alerts) (Dagster Cloud only)

## Limitations

- **Dagster's UI is tested with a maximum of 1000 checks per asset.** It's designed with the expectation that most assets will have fewer than 50 checks. If you have a use case that doesn't fit these limits, reach out to Dagster support to discuss.

- **Checks are currently only supported per-asset, not per-partition.** See [this issue](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/17005) for updates.
