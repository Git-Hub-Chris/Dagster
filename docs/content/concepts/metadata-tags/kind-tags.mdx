# Kind Tags

Kind tags can help you quickly identify the underlying system or technology used for a given asset in the Dagster UI. These tags allow you to organize assets within a Dagster project and can be used to filter or search across all your assets.

## Adding Compute Kinds to assets

You can add a tag to any asset by providing a value to the `compute_kind` argument.

```python
@asset(compute_kind="dbt")
def my_asset():
    pass
```

In the Dagster UI, a kind tag will appear on the asset. <Image src="/images/concepts/metadata-tags/kinds/kind-tag.png" width={1039} height={484} />

## Supported Icons

Some kinds are given a branded icon in the UI. We currently support nearly 200 unique technology icons.

## Requesting additional icons

The kinds icon pack is open source and anyone can <a href="/community/contributing"> contribute new icons</a> to the public repo or request a new icon by <a href="https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+feature-request&projects=&template=request_a_feature.yml">filing an issue</a>. Custom icons per deployment are not currently supported.
