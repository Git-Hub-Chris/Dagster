# Ops

Ops are the functional unit of work in Dagster. Multiple ops can be connected to create a [Job or Graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs-graphs).

## Overview

Ops are Dagster's atomic unit of computation. Individual ops should perform relatively simple tasks. Collections of ops can then be assembled into [Jobs or Graphs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs-graphs) to perform more complex tasks. Some examples of tasks appropriate for a single op:

- Add computed columns to a dataframe.
- Execute a database query.
- Initiate a Spark job in a remote cluster.
- Query an API and store the result in a data warehouse.
- Send an email or Slack message.

The op as computational unit enables many useful features for dataflow programming:

- **Flexible execution strategies**: Data pipelines are frequently developed locally and later deployed to production. Ops represent sealed units of logic independent of pipeline execution strategy, making the transition from development to production painless. Collections of ops (i.e. [Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs-graphs)) can be passed to an appropriate [Executor](/deployment/executors) for single-process execution or distribution across a cluster.
- **Input and output management**: Ops have defined [inputs and outputs](#inputs-and-outputs) analogous to the arguments and return value(s) of a Python function. However, op inputs/outputs can be more richly annotated than Python function arguments. This annotation can instruct Dagster's engines how to validate, cache, serialize, and otherwise manage data as it flows between ops.
- **Configuration**: Operations in a data pipeline are often parameterized by both upstream data (e.g. a stream of database records) and "configuration" values independent of upstream data (e.g. a "chunk size" of incoming records to operate on). Op configuration values can be defined and annotated in much the same way as inputs and outputs.
- **Event streams**: Ops emit a stream of [Events](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-events) during execution. Certain events are emitted by default (e.g. indicating the start of an op's execution), but op authors are additionally given access to an event API. This can be used to report data asset creation or modification (<PyObject object="AssetMaterialization"/>), the result of a data quality check (<PyObject object="ExpectationResult"/>), or other arbitrary information. Event streams can be visualized by Dagster's browser UI [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit). This rich log of execution facilitates debugging, inspection, and real-time monitoring of pipeline execution and data asset production.
- **Testability**: The properties that enable flexible execution of ops also facilitate versatile testing. Ops can be [tested](/concepts/testing) in isolation or as part of a pipeline. Further, the [Resource](/concepts/resources) API allows external systems (e.g. databases) to be stubbed or substituted as needed.

## Defining an op

To define an op, use the <PyObject object="op" decorator /> decorator. The decorated function is called the `compute_fn`.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_op_marker endbefore=end_op_marker
@op
def my_op():
    return "hello"
```

### Inputs and Outputs

Each op has a set of inputs and outputs, which define the data it consumes and produces. Inputs and outputs are used to define dependencies between ops and to pass data between ops.

Both definitions have a few important properties:

- They are named.
- They are optionally typed. These types are validated at runtime.
- (Advanced) They can be linked to an <PyObject object="IOManager"/>, which defines how the output or input is stored and loaded. See the [IOManager concept page](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) for more info.

#### Inputs

Inputs are passed as arguments to an op's `compute_fn`. The value of an input can be passed from the output of another op, or stubbed (hardcoded) using config.

The most common way to define inputs is just to add arguments to the decorated function:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_input_op_marker endbefore=end_input_op_marker
@op
def my_input_op(abc, xyz):
    pass
```

An op only starts to execute once all of its inputs have been resolved. Inputs can be resolved in two ways:

- The upstream output that the input depends on has been successfully emitted and stored.
- The input was stubbed through config.

You can use a [Dagster Type](/concepts/types) to provide a function that validates an op's input every time the op runs. In this case, you use a dictionary of <PyObject object="In" pluralize /> corresponding to the decorated function arguments.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_typed_input_op_marker endbefore=end_typed_input_op_marker
MyDagsterType = DagsterType(type_check_fn=lambda _, value: value % 2 == 0, name="MyDagsterType")


@op(ins={"abc": In(dagster_type=MyDagsterType)})
def my_typed_input_op(abc):
    pass
```

#### Outputs

Outputs are yielded from an op's `compute_fn`. By default, all ops have a single output called "result".

When you have one output, you can return the output value directly.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_output_op_marker endbefore=end_output_op_marker
@op
def my_output_op():
    return 5
```

To define multiple outputs, or to use a different output name than "result", you can provide a dictionary of <PyObject object="Out" pluralize /> to the <PyObject object="op" decorator /> decorator.

When you have more than one output, you can return a tuple of values, one for each output.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_multi_output_op_marker endbefore=end_multi_output_op_marker
@op(out={"first_output": Out(), "second_output": Out()})
def my_multi_output_op():
    return 5, 6
```

Like inputs, outputs can also have [Dagster Types](/concepts/types).

### Op Context

When writing an op, users can optionally provide a first parameter, `context`. When this parameter is supplied, Dagster will supply a context object to the body of the op. The context provides access to system information like op configuration, loggers, resources, and the current run id. See <PyObject object="OpExecutionContext"/> for the full list of properties accessible from the op context.

For example, to access the logger and log a info message:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_op_context_marker endbefore=end_op_context_marker
@op(config_schema={"name": str})
def context_op(context):
    name = context.op_config["name"]
    context.log.info(f"My name is {name}")
```

### Op Configuration

All definitions in dagster expose a `config_schema`, making them configurable and parameterizable. The configuration system is explained in detail on [Config Schema](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).

Op definitions can specify a `config_schema` for the op's configuration. The configuration is accessible through the [op context](#op-context) at runtime. Therefore, op configuration can be used to specify op behavior at runtime, making ops more flexible and reusable.

For example, we can define an op where the API endpoint it queries is define through it's configuration:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_configured_op_marker endbefore=end_configured_op_marker
@op(config_schema={"api_endpoint": str})
def my_configurable_op(context):
    api_endpoint = context.op_config["api_endpoint"]
    data = requests.get(f"{api_endpoint}/data").json()
    return data
```

## Using an op

Ops are used within a [Job or Graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs-graphs). You can also execute a single op, usually within a test context, by directly invoking it. More information can be found at [Testing ops](/concepts/testing#testing-ops).

## Patterns

### Op Factory

You may find the need to create utilities that help generate ops. In most cases, you should parameterize op behavior by adding op configuration. You should reach for this pattern if you find yourself needing to vary the arguments to the <PyObject object="op" decorator /> decorator or <PyObject object="OpDefinition"/> themselves, since they cannot be modified based on op configuration.

To create an op factory, you define a function that returns an <PyObject object="OpDefinition"/>, either directly or by decorating a function with the op decorator.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_op_factory_pattern_marker endbefore=end_op_factory_pattern_marker
def x_op(
    arg,
    name="default_name",
    ins=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Args:
        args (any): One or more arguments used to generate the nwe op
        name (str): The name of the new op.
        ins (Dict[str, In]): Any Ins for the new op. Default: None.

    Returns:
        function: The new op.
    """

    @op(name=name, ins=ins or {"start": In(Nothing)}, **kwargs)
    def _x_op(context):
        # Op logic here
        pass

    return _x_op
```
