# Graphs

A graph is a set of interconnected [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) or sub-graphs. Graphs form the core of [jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs).

| <PyObject module="dagster" object="graph" decorator /> | The decorator used to define a graph, which can form the basis for multiple jobs.                                                                                                                                             |
| <PyObject module="dagster" object="GraphDefinition" /> | A graph definition, which is a set of ops (or [sub-graphs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/nesting-graphs)) wired together. Forms the core of a job. Typically constructed using the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> decorator. |

## Creating graphs

- Input/output?
- Config?
- Resources?

### Using the @graph decorator

### To back assets

[TODO](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#graph-backed-assets)

### Complex graphs

- [Nesting graphs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/nesting-graphs), which are graphs that contain other graphs
- [Dynamic graphs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/dynamic-graphs)
