# Dagster UI

The Dagster UI is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

You can inspect Dagster objects (ex: assets, jobs, schedules), launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

---

## Launching the UI

The easiest way to launch the UI from the command line during local development is to run:

```shell
dagster dev
```

This command launches both the Dagster webserver (which serves the UI) and the [Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon), allowing you to start a full local deployment of Dagster from the command line.

The command will print out the URL you can access the UI from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

When invoked, the UI will fetch definitions - such as assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, and resources - from a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in a Python module or package or the code locations configured in an open source deployment's [workspace files](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files). Refer to the [Code location documentation](/concepts/code-locations) for more info.

You can also launch the webserver by itself from the command line by running:

```shell
dagster-webserver
```

Note that several Dagster features, like schedules and sensors, require the Dagster daemon to be running in order to function.

## Overview

Clicking **Overview** in the top navigation bar opens the **Overview** page, also known as the "factory floor".

This page provides a high-level look at all the activity in your Dagster deployment, across all code locations. This includes information about [runs](#runs), [jobs](#jobs), [schedules](#schedules), [sensors](#sensors), [resources](#resources), and backfills, all of which can be accessed using the tabs on this page.

## Assets

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Asset catalog">

### Asset catalog

- **Description**: The **Asset catalog** page lists all [assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) in your Dagster deployment, which can be filtered by asset key and/or [asset group](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#grouping-assets). Clicking an asset opens the [**Asset details** page](#asset-details) for that asset. You can also navigate to the [Global asset lineage](#global-asset-lineage) page, reload definitions, and materialize assets.

- **Accessed by:** Clicking **Assets** in the top navigation bar

  - Reload definitions
  - Materialize all or a selection of assets
  - View [run details](#run-details) for the latest materialization of any asset

- **Accessed by**:

  - **From the [Asset catalog](#asset-catalog)**: Clicking **View global asset lineage**, located near the top right corner of the page
  - **From the [Asset details](#asset-details) page**: Clicking the **Lineage tab**

### Run details

- **Description**: The **Run details** page contains details about a single run, including timing information, errors, and logs. The upper left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each asset or op took to execute. The bottom pane displays filterable events and logs emitted during execution.

  You can also re-execute a run using the same configuration by clicking the **Re-execute** button. Related runs (e.g., runs created by re-executing the same previous run) are grouped in the right pane for easy reference.

  There are several re-execution options:

  - **All steps**: Re-execute the run from scratch.
  - **Selected steps**: Re-execute the selected steps.
  - **From selected**: Re-execute the steps downstream from the selected steps
  - **From failure**: Retry the run, skipping steps completed successfully. This is only enabled when the run has failed.
