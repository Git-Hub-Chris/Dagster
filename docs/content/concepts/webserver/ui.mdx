# Dagster UI

The Dagster UI is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

You can inspect op, job, and graph definitions, launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

---

## Launching the UI

The easiest way to launch the UI from the command line during local development is to run:

```shell
dagster dev
```

This command launches both the Dagster webserver (which serves the UI) and the [Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon), allowing you to start a full local deployment of Dagster from the command line.

The command will print out the URL you can access the UI from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

When invoked, the UI will fetch definitions - such as assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, and resources - from a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in a Python module or package or the code locations configured in an open source deployment's [workspace files](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files). Refer to the [Code location documentation](/concepts/code-locations) for more info.

You can also launch the webserver by itself from the command line by running:

```shell
dagster-webserver
```

Note that several Dagster features, like schedules and sensors, require the Dagster daemon to be running in order to function.

## Navigating the UI

These are the main pages inside the UI:

- [Jobs](#jobs)
- [Runs](#runs)
- [Assets](#assets)
- [Schedules and sensors](#schedules-and-sensors)
- [Deployment overview](#deployment-overview)

### Jobs

The Job page offers tools to explore a job definition and launch runs for that job.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Overview tab">

#### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab shows the graph of ops that make up a job.

- [Job definition](#job-definition)
- [Op definition](#op-definition)

##### **Job definition**

In this tab, you can view the definition of a job:

<!-- ![UI Job Definition](/images/tutorial/complex-job.png) -->

<Image
alt="UI Job Definition"
src="/images/tutorial/complex-job.png"
width={2313}
height={1298}
/>

<br></br>

##### **Op definition**

To view detailed information about an op in the job, click an op to open a panel on the right side of the page:

<!-- ![UI Op Definition](/images/concepts/webserver/op-definition.png) -->

<Image

width={2315}
height={1299}
/>

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Launchpad tab">

#### Launchpad tab

The **Launchpad tab** provides a configuration editor to let you experiment with configuration and launch runs:

<!-- ![UI Launchpad](/images/tutorial/single-op-launchpad.png) -->

/>

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Runs tab">

#### Runs tab

The Runs tab displays a list of recent runs for the job:

<!-- ![UI Job runs tab](/images/concepts/webserver/runs-tab.png) -->

<Image
alt="UI Job runs tab"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/runs-tab.png"
width={1446}
height={754}
/>

---

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Runs

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="All runs">

#### All runs

The Runs page lists all job runs, which can be filtered by job name, run ID, execution status, or tag. Click a run ID to open the [**Run details** page](#run-details) and view details for that run:

<!-- ![UI Runs page](/images/concepts/webserver/all-runs.png) -->

<Image
alt="UI Runs page"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/all-runs.png"
width={1861}
height={1300}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Run details">

#### Run details

The **Run details** page contains details about a single run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

The upper left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each op took to execute. The bottom pane displays filterable events and logs emitted during the course of execution:

<!-- ![UI Job run](/images/concepts/webserver/single-run.png) -->

<Image
alt="UI Job run"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/single-run.png"
width={2318}
height={1298}
/>

From the **Run details** page, you can also re-execute a run using the same configuration by clicking the **Re-execute** button:

<!-- ![UI job re-execution button](/images/concepts/webserver/re-execution.png) -->

<Image
alt="UI job re-execution button"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/single-run.png"
width={2318}
height={1298}
/>

There are several re-execution options:

- **All Steps**: Re-execute the run from scratch.
- **Selected Steps**: Re-execute the selected steps.
- **From Selected**: Re-execute the steps downstream from the selected steps
- **From Failure**: Retry the run, skipping steps completed successfully. This is only enabled when the run has failed.

Related runs (e.g., runs created by re-executing the same previous run) are grouped together in the right pane for easy reference.

### Assets

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Asset catalog">

#### Asset catalog

The **Asset catalog** page lists all assets, which can be filtered by asset key. Click an asset to open the [**Asset details** page](#asset-details):

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Asset details">

#### Asset details

The **Asset details** page contains details about a single asset:

<!-- ![UI Asset Details](/images/concepts/webserver/asset.png) -->

</TabGroup>

### Schedules and sensors

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Schedules">

#### Schedules

The Schedules page lists all schedules defined in your workspace, as well as information about upcoming ticks for anticipated scheduled runs.

Click a schedule to view details about the schedule, including its recent tick history and recent runs.

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Sensors">
