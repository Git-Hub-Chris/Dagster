# Automating assets using schedules and jobs

After you've created some [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets), you'll likely want to automate their materialization.

In this guide, we'll show you one method of accomplishing this by using schedules and jobs. If you're looking to do this for ops, refer to the [Defining schedules for ops guide](/concepts/automation/schedules/running-ops).

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Create a job that materializes some assets
- Create a schedule
- Add the new job and schedule to your project's <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object
- Turn the schedule on

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **To have Dagster and the Dagster UI installed.** Refer to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more info and instructions.
- **Familiarity with**:
  - [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
  - [Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)
  - [Code locations](/concepts/code-locations) (<PyObject object="Definitions" />)

---

## Step 1: Create a job

The first step in creating a schedule is to build a job that materializes some assets. Let's assume we already have a few assets in our project, in a group named `ecommerce_assets`:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_assets endbefore=end_assets
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-repo/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py'
```

To create a job that materializes the assets in this group, we'll use <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_job endbefore=end_job
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-repo/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py'
```

To do this, we:

1. Imported <PyObject object="AssetSelection" /> and <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />
2. Used <PyObject object="define_asset_job" /> to construct the job and name it `ecommerce_asset_job`
3. Used <PyObject object="AssetSelection" /> to select all assets in the `ecommerce_assets` group. Only these assets will be materialized when the job runs.

Refer to the [Asset jobs documentation](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) for more info and examples.

---

## Step 2: Define the schedule

Next, we'll use <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to construct the schedule and attach it to the job we created in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-job).

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_schedule endbefore=end_schedule
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-repo/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py'
```

In this example, we:

1. Imported <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> and the `ecommerce_asset_job`
2. Uused <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to create a schedule that:

   - Is attached to the `ecommerce_assets_job` job
   - Has a cron expression of `15 5 * * 1-5`, which translates to `Every Monday through Friday of every month at 5:15AM`
   - Is turned on by default (`default_status`). We'll discuss this more in [Step 4](#step-4-turn-the-schedule-on).

---

## Step 3: Update the Definitions object

Next, we'll update our project's <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object to include our new job and schedule. This ensures the job and schedule are available to Dagster processes like the Dagster UI.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py startafter=start_definitions endbefore=end_definitions
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-repo/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py'
```

At this point, our code looks like this:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py lines=3-10,14-23,30-34,41-47,54-60
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-repo/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py'
```

---

## Step 4: Turn the schedule on

Schedules need to be turned on before they can be used. In our case, we already turned the schedule on by using the `default_status` parameter in its <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />, but there are a few other ways to do this:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Dagster UI">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Starting or stopping a schedule in the UI overrides
  any default status set in code.
</Note>

In the Dagster UI using the **Schedules** tab:

<Image
alt="Schedules tab in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules-tab-toggle.png"
width={1164}
height={280}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="CLI">

Using the [dagster CLI](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-schedule):

```shell
dagster schedule start
dagster schedule stop
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Python code">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Starting or stopping a schedule in the UI overrides
  any default status set in code.
</Note>

The default status can be set using `DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING` in the schedule's <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py lines=43-47
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/erincochran/Desktop/dagster-repo/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_asset_schedule.py'
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

Once the schedule is started, it will begin executing immediately if the [dagster-daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) process is running - which is started automatically when `dagster dev` is run - as part of your deployoment.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/troubleshooting) guide if the schedule has been started but isn't submitting runs.

## What's next?

That's it! At this point, you should have a working, running schedule in your Dagster project. From here, you can:

- Check out the [Schedule examples](/concepts/automation/schedules/examples) for ideas and inspiration
- Create [tests for your schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules/testing) to make sure things are running smoothly
- Refer to the [Automating pipelines guide](/guides/dagster/automating-pipelines) for more pipeline automation ideas
