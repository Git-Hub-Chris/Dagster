# A single-op job

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/" />

Dagster's asset functionality sits on top of a general orchestration engine that can be used for tasks other than creating and maintaining assets. The core abstractions of this engine are **[ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops)** and **[jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)**.

**[Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops)** are individual units of computation that we wire together to form **[jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)**.

In this section, we'll cover how to define a simple job with a single op, and then execute it.

---

## Hello, op!

Let's write our first Dagster op and save it as `hello.py`.

Typically, you'll define ops by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="op" displayText="@op" /> decorator.

Our first op finds the sizes of all the files in our current directory and logs them.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/hello.py startafter=start_op_marker endbefore=end_op_marker
import os
from dagster import job, op, get_dagster_logger


@op
def get_file_sizes():
    files = [f for f in os.listdir(".") if os.path.isfile(f)]
    for f in files:
        get_dagster_logger().info(f"Size of {f} is {os.path.getsize(f)}")
```

In this simple case, our op takes no arguments, and also returns no outputs. Don't worry, we'll soon encounter ops that are more dynamic.

---

## Hello, job!

To execute our op, we'll embed it in an equally simple job. A job is a set of ops arranged into a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computation. You'll typically define jobs by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject
module="dagster" object="job" displayText="@job" /> decorator.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/hello.py startafter=start_job_marker endbefore=end_job_marker
@job
def file_sizes_job():
    get_file_sizes()
```

Here you'll see that we call `get_file_sizes()`. This call doesn't actually execute the op. Within the bodies of functions decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="job"
displayText="@job" />, we use function calls to indicate the dependency structure of the op making up the job. Here, we indicate that the execution of `get_file_sizes` doesn't depend on any other ops by calling it with no arguments.

## Executing our first job

Assuming you’ve saved this job as `hello.py`, you can execute it via any of three different mechanisms:

### Dagit

To visualize your job (which only has one op) in Dagit, just run the following. Make sure you're in the directory in which you've saved the job file:

```bash
dagit -f hello.py
```

You'll see output like:

```bash
Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your web browser and view your job. It isn't very interesting yet, because it only has one op.

<!-- ![single-op job](/images/tutorial/single-op-job.png) -->

<Image
alt="single-op job"
src="/images/tutorial/single-op-job.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

Click on the **Launchpad** tab and you'll see the view below.

<!-- ![single-op launchpad](/images/tutorial/single-op-launchpad.png) -->

<Image
alt="single-op launchpad"
src="/images/tutorial/single-op-launchpad.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

The large upper left pane is empty here, but, in jobs with parameters, this is where you'll be able to edit job configuration on the fly.

Click the **Launch Run** button on the bottom right to execute this job directly from Dagit. A new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1—or, just navigate to the **Runs** tab to see this, and every run of your job.

<!-- ![single-op run](/images/tutorial/single-op-run.png) -->

<Image
alt="single-op run"
src="/images/tutorial/single-op-run.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to your job run.

### Dagster CLI

From the directory in which you've saved the job file, just run:

```bash
dagster job execute -f hello.py
```

You'll see the full stream of events emitted by Dagster appear in the console, including our call to the logging machinery, which will look like:

```bash
2021-02-05 08:50:25 - dagster - INFO - system - ce5d4576-2569-44ff-a14a-51010eea5329 - hello - ...
```

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather execute your jobs as a script, you can do that without using the Dagster CLI at all. Just add a few lines to `hello.py`

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/hello.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = file_sizes_job.execute_in_process()
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python hello.py
```
