# Tutorial, part one: Intro to Dagster

Dagster is an orchestrator that's designed for developing and maintaining data assets, such as tables, data sets, machine learning models, and reports.

In this tutorial, you'll analyze activity on the popular news aggregation website, Hacker News. You'll fetch data from the website, clean it up, and build a report that summarizes some findings. You'll then tell Dagster to occasionally update the data and the report, which Dagster calls _assets_.

## Introduction to Software-defined assets

Before building a Dagster project, you'll first learn about Dagster's core concept: the Software-defined asset (SDA).

An asset is an object in persistent storage that captures some understanding of the world. Assets can be any type of object, such as:

- A database table or view
- A file, such as in your local machine or blob storage like Amazon S3
- A machine learning model

If you have an existing data pipeline, you likely already have assets.

Software-defined assets are Dagster's way of enabling data engineers to deliver value and control their data pipelines. Writing SDAs lets you focus on the contents of the data and less on other aspects like what it depends on, how it's stored, or when it needs to be refreshed.

As a Dagster user, you're able to build assets in code. In the sample asset below, the DataFrame returned is an asset and Dagster recognizes that the function is an SDA.

```python
@asset
def topstories(topstory_ids):
    results = []
    for item_id in topstory_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

    return pd.DataFrame(results)
```

### Building a DAG of assets

Defining multiple assets creates a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of what assets depend on other assets. This DAG helps you to:

- Understand how your assets relate to each other
- Empower you and your teammates to act, learn, and debug your pipelines

Your DAGs are viewable in Dagster's web-based UI, shown below:

<Note>
  Assets enable the best long-term approach for building pipelines in Dagster
  and this tutorial focuses on them. However, developers can use Dagster's Ops
  and Graphs when tasks are needed. For more on Ops and Graphs, refer to{" "}

## Next steps

In this section, you learned how Software-defined assets are the building blocks of Dagster and also about the benefits of asset-based pipelines.

Within your current data pipelines, you likely have many assets. Or if you are earlier in your data journey, you might have an understanding of what data your stakeholders need.

When going through this tutorial, think about what benefits you'll be receiving by treating your data as Software-defined assets in Dagster.

In [the next section](/tutorial/setup), you'll install Dagster on your computer and start a new project.
