# Intro to Software-defined assets: Getting set up

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install Python and pip.** This tutorial assumes that you have some familiarity with Python, but you should be able to follow along even if youâ€™re coming from a different programming language. To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment or install them, follow the instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

<!-- ^ Lives in: /next/components/mdx/includes/dagster/DagsterVersion.mdx -->

- **To install Dagster, Dagit, and the `requests` library**:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagit requests
  ```

  This installs a few packages:

  - **Dagster**. The core programming model and abstraction stack; stateless, single-node, single-process and multi-process execution engines; and a CLI tool for driving those engines. Refer to the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more info, including how to ensure your environment is set up correctly.
  - **Dagit**: The web-based UI for developing and operating Dagster jobs, including a DAG browser, a type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface.
  - **Requests**: While not a part of Dagster, we'll use this in the tutorial to download data from the internet.
