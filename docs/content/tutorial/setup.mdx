# Tutorial, part two: Getting set up

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install Python and pip.** This tutorial assumes that you have some familiarity with Python, but you should be able to follow along even if you're coming from a different programming language. To check that Python and `pip` (Python's package manager) are already installed in your environment or install them, follow the instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). <DagsterVersion />

- To install Dagster, Dagit, and the packages you'll be using during this tutorial, run the following command from your terminal:

  ```bash
  pip install dagster dagit requests pandas matplotlib dagster_duckdb dagster_duckdb_pandas
  ```

  This installs the following Python packages:

  - `dagster` is the command line interface (CLI) tool to run Dagster. For more information, refer to the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install).
  - `dagit` is the web-based UI for operating Dagster jobs, a library for your assets, a type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface

  It also installs packages that aren't necessary for every Dagster project but are used for this tutorial. You don't have to read up on them, but if you're curious:

  - `requests` will be used to download data from the internet
  - `pandas` is a popular library for working with tabular data
  - `matplotlib` makes it easy to make charts in Python
  - `dagster_duckdb` manages how Dagster can read and write to DuckDB, an in-memory data warehouse similar to SQLite, that you'll use for this tutorial
  - `dagster_duckdb_pandas` allows loading data from DuckDB into Pandas DataFrames

## Creating your first Dagster project

To verify that your Dagster installation was successful, it's time for you to create your first Dagster project! You'll use the Dagster scaffolding command to give you an empty Dagster project that you can run locally.

To create the project, run:

```bash
dagster project scaffold --name tutorial-project
```

To verify that it worked and that you can run Dagster locally, run:

```bash
cd tutorial-project
dagster dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the Dagster UI. This command will run Dagster until you're ready to stop it. To stop the long-running process, press Control+C from the terminal that the process is running on.

If you'd like an explanation of what files were made and why, refer to the [Creating a new Dagster project guide](/getting-started/create-new-project#using-the-default-project-skeleton).

## Ready to get started?

When you've made your first Dagster project, you are ready to start writing your own pipeline by [creating your first asset](/tutorial/writing-your-first-asset).
