# Tutorial, part four: Building an asset graph

In the previous portion of the tutorial, you wrote your first Software-defined asset (SDA), looked at Dagster's UI, and manually materialized your asset.

Continuing from there, you will:

- Add more assets to your Dagster project
- Connect them to finish migrating the pipeline
- Give users more knowledge about the assets by adding metadata and logging

---

## Step 1: Adding the DataFrame asset

By the end of the previous section, you ingested the top Hacker News story IDs into Dagster. Using this data, you'll now look up each story by its ID, ingest that data, and make a DataFrame out of it. You'll connect your current asset with this new asset to establish dependencies and make an _asset graph_.

Copy and paste the completed asset code below into `assets.py`:

<Note>
  Add new imports, such as <code>import pandas as pd</code>, to the top of{" "}
  <code>assets.py</code>
</Note>

```python file=/tutorial/building_an_asset_graph/assets_initial_state.py startafter=start_topstories_asset endbefore=end_topstories_asset
import pandas as pd  # Add new imports to the top of `assets.py`
import requests

from dagster import asset


@asset
def topstories(topstory_ids):  # this asset is dependent on topstory_ids
    results = []
    for item_id in topstory_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

        if len(results) % 20 == 0:
            print(f"Got {len(results)} items so far.")  # noqa: T201

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    return df
```

Dependencies between assets are defined by adding the asset name as a parameter to the dependent asset's function. In this case, `topstory_ids` (the list of IDs) is a dependency of `topstories` (the DataFrame).

In your browser, navigate to Dagster's UI (`localhost:3000`) and look at the asset graph to see the relationship between your assets.

### Flexibility with asset dependencies

If this syntax is too magical for you, an asset's dependencies can be explicitly defined using a parameter called `ins` in the <PyObject module="dagster" object="asset" displayText="@asset"/> decorator. To learn about this syntax, refer to the [Defining explicit dependencies section of the Assets concept page](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-explicit-dependencies).

Other times, it's impossible to contain the business logic in a function or you'll never want to load the data into memory. In situations like these, you can return no data. Dependencies can also be made without loading data in the dependent asset's function. Refer to the guide on [Assets without I/O](/guides/dagster/non-argument-deps) for more information about these patterns.

### Logging during asset materialization

In the code above, a `print` statement is used to show progress while fetching stories from the Hacker News API. Dagster has a built-in logger that extends past `print` and other Python logging methods. This logger shows exactly where logging happens in your Dagster project, such as which asset and materialization the log came from.

To access the logger, use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="get_dagster_logger" displayText="get_dagster_logger"/> function. The code below replaces the `print` statement with the Dagster logger:

```python file=/tutorial/building_an_asset_graph/asset_with_logger.py startafter=start_topstories_asset_with_logger endbefore=end_topstories_asset_with_logger
from dagster import asset, get_dagster_logger


@asset
def topstories(topstory_ids):
    logger = get_dagster_logger()

    results = []
    for item_id in topstory_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

        if len(results) % 20 == 0:
            logger.info(f"Got {len(results)} items so far.")

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    return df
```

For more information about loggers, such as the different types of logging, refer to the [Logging documentation](/concepts/logging/loggers).

---

## Step 2: Creating an unstructured data asset

Along with structured data like tables, Dagster's assets can also be unstructured data, such as images. Your next and final asset will take the DataFrame of stories and create a dictionary of the most frequent words in the titles.

Below is the finished code for a `most_frequent_words` asset. Copy and paste the code into `assets.py`:

```python file=/tutorial/building_an_asset_graph/assets_initial_state.py startafter=start_most_frequent_words_asset endbefore=end_most_frequent_words_asset
@asset
def most_frequent_words(topstories):
    stopwords = ["a", "the", "an", "of", "to", "in", "for", "and", "with", "on", "is"]

    # loop through the titles and count the frequency of each word
    word_counts = {}
    for raw_title in topstories["title"]:
        title = raw_title.lower()
        for word in title.split():
            cleaned_word = word.strip(".,-!?:;()[]'\"-")
            if cleaned_word not in stopwords and len(cleaned_word) > 0:
                word_counts[cleaned_word] = word_counts.get(cleaned_word, 0) + 1

    # Get the top 25 most frequent words
    top_words = {
        pair[0]: pair[1]
        for pair in sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:25]
    }

    return top_words
```

## Step 3: Educating users with metadata

Software-defined assets can be enriched with different types of metadata. Anything can be used as metadata for an SDA. Common details to add are:

- Statistics about the data, such as row counts or other data profiling
- Test results or assertions about the data
- Images or tabular previews of the asset
- Information about who owns the asset, where it's stored, and links to external documentation

The following code adds a row count and a preview of the `topstories` asset. It uses the <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" displayText="Output"/> class from Dagster to bundle the asset and its metadata together. Update your code for the `topstories` asset to match the changes below.

```python file=/tutorial/building_an_asset_graph/assets_with_metadata.py startafter=start_topstories_asset_with_metadata endbefore=end_topstories_asset_with_metadata
import base64
from io import BytesIO

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import requests

from dagster import (
    AssetKey,
    DagsterInstance,
    MetadataValue,
    Output,
    asset,
    get_dagster_logger,
)

# Add the imports above to the top of `assets.py`


@asset
def topstories(topstory_ids):
    logger = get_dagster_logger()

    results = []
    for item_id in topstory_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

        if len(results) % 20 == 0:
            logger.info(f"Got {len(results)} items so far.")

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    return Output(  # The return value is updated to wrap it in `Output` class
        value=df,  # The original df is passed in with the `value` parameter
        metadata={
            "num_records": len(df),  # Metadata can be any key-value pair
            "preview": MetadataValue.md(df.head().to_markdown()),
            # The `MetadataValue` class has useful static methods to build Metadata
        },
    )
```

Reload the definitions and re-materialize your assets. The metadata can then be seen in the following places:

- In the **Asset graph** page, click on an asset and its metadata will be shown in the right sidebar:

  <Image
  alt="the asset's materialization metadata"
  src="/images/tutorial/asset-metadata.png"
  width={1152}
  height={666}
  />

- In the **Asset Catalog's** page for the `topstories` asset:

  <Image
  alt="the asset's materialization metadata"
  src="/images/tutorial/asset-catalog-metadata.png"
  width={1152}
  height={667}
  />

### Metadata and Markdown

The DataFrame was embedded into the asset's metadata with Markdown. Any valid Markdown snippet can be stored and rendered in the Dagster UI, including images. By embedding a bar chart of the most frequently used words as metadata, you and your team can visualize and analyze the `most_frequent_words` asset without leaving the Dagster UI.

Below is code that changes shows how to add an an image of a bar chart in asset metadata. Add the following to the end of your `assets.py`:

```python file=/tutorial/building_an_asset_graph/assets_with_metadata.py startafter=start_most_frequent_words_asset_with_metadata endbefore=end_most_frequent_words_asset_with_metadata
@asset
def most_frequent_words(topstories):
    stopwords = ["a", "the", "an", "of", "to", "in", "for", "and", "with", "on", "is"]

    # loop through the titles and count the frequency of each word
    word_counts = {}
    for raw_title in topstories["title"]:
        title = raw_title.lower()
        for word in title.split():
            cleaned_word = word.strip(".,-!?:;()[]'\"-")
            if cleaned_word not in stopwords and len(cleaned_word) > 0:
                word_counts[cleaned_word] = word_counts.get(cleaned_word, 0) + 1

    # Get the top 25 most frequent words
    top_words = {
        pair[0]: pair[1]
        for pair in sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:25]
    }

    # Make a bar chart of the top 25 words
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.bar(top_words.keys(), top_words.values())
    plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
    plt.title("Top 25 Words in Hacker News Titles")
    plt.tight_layout()

    # Convert the image to a saveable format
    buffer = BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(buffer, format="png")
    image_data = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue())

    # Convert the image to Markdown to preview it within Dagster
    md_content = f"![img](data:image/png;base64,{image_data.decode()})"

    # Attach the Markdown content as metadata to the asset
    return Output(
        value=top_words,
        metadata={"plot": MetadataValue.md(md_content)},
    )
```

Reload your definitions and rematerialize your assets. The bar chart will be visible with the rest of your materialization metadata for the `most_frequent_words` asset. The `path` key in the metadata will contain a link that says **\[Show Markdown]**. Clicking on the link will open the preview in the Dagster UI. The bar chart will change throughout the day as the top stories change. Here's an example of what `most_frequent_words` looked like at the time we wrote this tutorial:

<Image
alt="the asset's materialization metadata"
src="/images/tutorial/bar-chart-preview.png"
width={1279}
height={943}
/>

<Note>
  If your data is sensitive, such as PHI or PII, be careful and follow your
  organization's policies for surfacing data. You should practice due diligence
  before showing your data in metadata or logs.
</Note>

## Next steps

By now, you've:

- Written and materialized three assets
- Previewed the data in Dagster's UI
- Empowered stakeholders and your future self with metadata and logging

In the next section, you'll learn how [to schedule your pipeline to automatically update your assets regularly](/tutorial/scheduling-your-pipeline).
