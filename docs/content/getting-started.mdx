# Welcome to Dagster!

<p className="text-2xl mt-0 text-gray-500 tracking-tight font-light">
  Dagster is the data orchestration platform built for productivity.
</p>

Dagster is a system for building and maintaining data assets, such as tables, data sets, machine learning models, reports and more.

With Dagster, you declare the [assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) that you want to exist, the [dependencies between them](), and [how they should be updated](). Dagster then takes responsibility for keeping your assets up-to-date as well as [tracking their history]().

Let's say you wanted to create a table using data from other assets and update it hourly. In Dagster, you could write this as:

```python
from dagster import AssetGroup, ScheduleDefinition, asset

@asset(io_manager="snowflake")
def recommendations(users, items, recommender):
    return recommender.predict(users, items)

schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=AssetGroup([recommendations]).build_job(),
    cron_schedule="@hourly",
)
```

Which translates to:

> Derive the `recommendations` table applying a function to the `users` table, the `items` table, and `recommender` machine learning model and update it every hour.

At Dagster’s core is a general-purpose orchestration engine that allows defining and executing graphs of arbitrary computations. For operations that don’t involve assets, you can program against this orchestrator directly.

## Using Dagster

- Dagit (incl. dependency graph, history/logs, materialization)
- Python APIs
- CLI

Dagster hosts an inspectable, versioned blueprint of the assets that you intend to exist and the history of computations that have mutated those assets. This can be used to surface discrepancies between your expected assets and the assets that exist in persistent storage. To resolve these discrepancies, Dagster can automatically kick off computations, or you can launch computations manually.

## Integrating with Dagster

Dagster’s integration libraries make it easy to declare assets that are computed using systems like dbt, Fivetran, Airbyte, and Spark.
