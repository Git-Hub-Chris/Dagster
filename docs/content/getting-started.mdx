# Welcome to Dagster!

<p className="text-2xl mt-0 text-gray-500 tracking-tight font-light">
  Dagster is the data orchestration platform built for productivity.
</p>

Get started with Dagster in just three quick steps:

1. [Install Dagster](#step-1-install-dagster)
2. [Define assets](#step-2-define-assets)
3. [Materialize the assets](#step-3-materialize-the-assets)

---

## Step 1: Install Dagster

<Note>
  Dagster requires Python 3.6+. Refer to the{" "}
  <a href="/getting-started/install">Installation documentation</a> for more
  info.
</Note>

To install Dagster into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
pip install dagster
```

This installs the latest stable version of the core Dagster packages in your current Python environment.

---

## Step 2: Define assets

To get started, we'll define two simple data [assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets):

- A `cereals` asset that represents a CSV dataset about breakfast cereals, and
- A `nabisco_cereals` asset, which is [a downstream dependency](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#assets-with-dependencies) of `cereals` and only contains cereals manufactured by Nabisco

In the directory where you installed Dagster, copy this code and save it in a file named `cereal.py`:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/cereal.py startafter=start_multiple_assets endbefore=end_multiple_assets
import csv
import requests
from dagster import asset


@asset
def cereals():
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    return [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]


@asset
def nabisco_cereals(cereals):
    """Cereals manufactured by Nabisco"""
    return [row for row in cereals if row["mfr"] == "N"]
```

---

## Step 3: Materialize the assets

Next, you'll materialize the assets. Materialization computes an asset's contents and writes them to persistent storage. By default, this is a pickle file on the local system.

There are a few ways to materialize an asset:

- [Dagit](#using-dagit)
- [Dagster Python API](#using-the-dagster-python-api)

### Using Dagit

[Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit) is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

1. To install Dagit, run:

   ```bash
   pip install dagit
   ```

2. To launch Dagit, run:

   ```bash
   dagit -f cereal.py
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```bash
   Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

3. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000> in your web browser to view your assets.

4. Click the **Materialize All** button to launch a run that materializes the assets:

### Using the Dagster Python API

You can also use the [Dagster Python API](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/job-execution#python-apis) to materialize the assets as a script.

Add a few lines to `cereal.py`, which executes a run within the Python process:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/cereal.py startafter=start_multiple_materialize_marker endbefore=end_multiple_materialize_marker
from dagster import materialize

if __name__ == "__main__":
    materialize([cereals, nabisco_cereals])
```

Now you can run:

```bash
python cereal.py
```
