# Dagster daemon

Several Dagster features, like [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), and [run queueing](/deployment/run-coordinator#limiting-run-concurrency), require a long-running `dagster-daemon` process to be included with your deployment.

---

## Starting the daemon

To start the `dagster-daemon` process locally, launch the following command in the same folder as your [workspace file (`workspace.yaml`)](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files) file and keep the process running:

```shell
$ dagster-daemon run
```

Refer to the [deployment guides](/deployment/guides) for more information on deploying the daemon in other environments, such as Docker or Kubernetes.

---

## Available daemons

The `dagster-daemon` process reads from your [Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance) file to determine which daemons should be included. Each of the included daemons then runs on a regular interval in its own threads.

The following daemons are currently available:

<table

    width: "100%",
  }}

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Daemons that need to load code location(s) will do so by periodically reloading your instance's [workspace file](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files). This means that the `dagster-daemon` process doesn't need to be restarted when workspace files are changed.

## Checking daemon status in Dagit

To check the status of the `dagster-daemon` process within Dagit:

1. In the top navigation, click **Deployment**.
2. Click the **Daemons** tab.

This tab displays information about all the daemons currently configured on your instance.

Each daemon periodically writes a heartbeat to your instance storage. If a daemon doesn't show a recent heartbeat, check the logs from your `dagster-daemon` process for errors.
