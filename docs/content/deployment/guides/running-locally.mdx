# Running Dagster Locally

The easiest way to start up Dagster services during local development is to run:

```shell
dagster dev
```

from a Python environment that has both the `dagster` and `dagit` Python packages installed. See the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more information on how to install those packages.

The `dagster dev` command launches both [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit) and the [Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) locally, allowing you to start a full deployment of Dagster from the command line. Once started, the process should be kept running.

There are a few ways that you can tell Dagster how to find the Python code containing your assets and jobs, which are outlined in the following tabs. If you've used the [dagster command line to create a project](/getting-started/create-new-project#bootstrapping-a-new-project) or are using a Dagster example project, you can simply run the `dagster dev` command in the same folder as the project in order to load that code.

## Run and asset storage

When running `dagster dev`, you may see log output that looks like this:

```shell
Using temporary directory /Users/rhendricks/tmpqs_fk8_5 for storage.
```

This indicates that any runs or materialized assets that are created during your session will not be persisted once the session ends. This can be useful when using Dagster for temporary local development or testing, when you don't care about the results being persisted.

To designate a more permanent home for your runs and assets, you can set the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable to a folder on your filesystem. Dagster will then use that folder for storage on all subsequent runs of `dagster dev`.

## Configuring your local instance

You can optionally use a `dagster.yaml` file to configure your Dagster instance - for example, to configure [run concurrency limits](/deployment/run-coordinator#limiting-run-concurrency) or or specify that runs should be stored in a [Postgres dataabase](/deployment/dagster-instance#postgres-storage) instead of on the filesystem.

If you have the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable set, `dagster dev` will look for a `dagster.yaml` file in the `DAGSTER_HOME` folder. If `DAGSTER_HOME` is not set, `dagster dev` will look for that file from the folder where the command was run.

For the full set of options that can be set in the `dagster.yaml` file, see the [Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance) section.

## Moving to Production

`dagster dev` is primarily useful for running Dagster for local development and testing, but is not suitable for the demands of most production deployments. For example, in a production deployment, you might want to run multiple Dagit replicas, have zero-downtime continuous deployment of your code, or set up your Dagster daemon to automatically restart if it crashes.

For information about deploying Dagster in production, see our other [Deploying Dagster guides](/deployment/open-source#deploying-dagster).
