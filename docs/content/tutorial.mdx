Dagster is used to build and maintain data assets. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the basics of creating, maintaining, and testing assets in Dagster.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- [Create an asset using a sample CSV dataset](/tutorial/assets/defining-an-asset)
- [Use multiple assets to build a graph](/tutorial/assets/asset-graph)
- [Understand how to define assets without arguments and return values](/tutorial/assets/non-argument-deps), which is useful when you don't want to load your assets into Python
- [Create tests for a single asset or multiple assets](/tutorial/assets/testing-assets)
- [Learn what's next in Dagster](/tutorial/assets/next-steps)

Ready to get started? In the next section, we'll show you how to [set up everything you need to complete the tutorial](/tutorial/setup).
