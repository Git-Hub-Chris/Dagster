# Intro to Software-defined assets

<Note>
  <strong>New to Dagster?</strong> Start here!
</Note>

Dagster is used to build and maintain data assets. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the basics of creating, maintaining, and testing assets in Dagster.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- [Create an asset using a sample CSV dataset](/tutorial/assets/defining-an-asset)
- [Use multiple assets to build a graph](/tutorial/assets/asset-graph)
- [Understand how to define assets without arguments and return values](/tutorial/assets/non-argument-deps), which is useful when you don't want to load your assets into Python
- [Create tests for a single asset or multiple assets](/tutorial/assets/testing-assets)

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install Python and pip.** This tutorial assumes that you have some familiarity with Python, but you should be able to follow along even if youâ€™re coming from a different programming language. To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment or install them, follow the instructions [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

- **To install Dagster, Dagit, and the `requests` library**:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagit requests
  ```

  This installs a few packages:

  - **Dagster**. The core programming model and abstraction stack; stateless, single-node, single-process and multi-process execution engines; and a CLI tool for driving those engines. Refer to the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more info, including how to ensure your environment is set up correctly.
  - **Dagit**: The web-based UI for developing and operating Dagster jobs, including a DAG browser, a type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface.
  - **Requests**: While not a part of Dagster, we'll use this in the tutorial to download data from the internet.
