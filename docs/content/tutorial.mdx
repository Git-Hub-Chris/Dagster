</Note>

Dagster is used to build and maintain data assets. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the basics of creating, maintaining, and testing assets in Dagster:

- [**Define an asset**](/guides/dagster/asset-tutorial) using a sample CSV dataset
- [**Build graphs of assets**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/assets/asset-graph) using multiple assets
- [**Test assets**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/assets/testing-assets), whether a single asset or multiple

### Ops and jobs

Dagster's asset functionality sits on top of a general orchestration engine that can be used for tasks other than creating and maintaining assets. Check out this op-focused tutorial to learn more:

- [**Write and execute an op job**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/ops-jobs/single-op-job) using a sample CSV dataset
- [**Connect ops in jobs**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/ops-jobs/connecting-ops) to create complex, multi-op jobs using a sample CSV dataset
- [**Test ops and jobs**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/ops-jobs/testable) with unit tests
