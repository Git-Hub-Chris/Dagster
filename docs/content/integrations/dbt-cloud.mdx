# Using dbt Cloud with Dagster

Dagster allows you to run dbt Cloud jobs alongside other technologies. You can schedule them to run on a regular basis, and as part of larger pipelines.

If you're using the dbt CLI, check out [Using dbt with Dagster](/integrations/dbt) instead!

## Running a dbt Cloud job

To run a dbt Cloud job, you'll need to configure three values:

- the `job_id` of the job you want to run
- the `account_id` of your dbt Cloud account
- an `auth_token` for connecting with the dbt Cloud API

The first two values can be obtained by navigating to the page for your job in the dbt Cloud console, and looking at the URL. For example, in this screenshot, the `account_id` is `11111`, and the `job_id` is `33333`:

The `auth_token` can also be found or generated in the dbt Cloud console. It's recommended that you use a [Service account token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-api/service-tokens) for this purpose, and that you store this value in an environment variable, rather than hardcoding its value in your codebase.

Putting it all together, you'll get the following:

```python startafter=start_dbt_cloud_job endbefore=end_dbt_cloud_job file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_cloud.py dedent=4
from dagster import job
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cloud_resource, dbt_cloud_run_op

# configure an operation to run the specific job
run_dbt_nightly_sync = dbt_cloud_run_op.configured(
    {"job_id": 33333}, name="run_dbt_nightly_sync"
)

# configure a resource to connect to your dbt Cloud instance
my_dbt_cloud_resource = dbt_cloud_resource.configured(
    {"auth_token": {"env": "DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN"}, "account_id": 11111}
)

# create a job that uses your op and resource
@job(resource_defs={"dbt_cloud": my_dbt_cloud_resource})
def my_dbt_cloud_job():
    run_dbt_nightly_sync()
```

---

## Running a dbt Cloud job after another op completes

The `dbt_cloud_run_op` has an optional `start_after` input. If you supply the output of another operation to this input, the dbt Cloud op will not start until that upstream operation successfully completes:

```python startafter=start_dbt_cloud_job2 endbefore=end_dbt_cloud_job2 file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_cloud.py dedent=4
@job(resource_defs={"dbt_cloud": my_dbt_cloud_resource})
def my_two_op_job():
    run_dbt_nightly_sync(start_after=another_op())
```

---

## Scheduling dbt Cloud jobs

You can run dbt Cloud jobs on a schedule in the same way as any other Dagster job:

```python startafter=start_schedule_dbt_cloud endbefore=end_schedule_dbt_cloud file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_cloud.py dedent=4
from dagster import ScheduleDefinition, repository

@repository
def my_repo():
    return [
        ScheduleDefinition(
            job=my_dbt_cloud_job,
            cron_schedule="@daily",
        ),
    ]
```

Refer to the [Schedule documentation](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules#running-the-scheduler) for more info on running jobs on a schedule.
