# Dagster Embedded ELT

This package provides a framework for building ELT pipelines with Dagster through helpful asset decorators and resources. It is in experimental development, and we'd love to hear your feedback.

This package includes two implementations:

1. <a href="https://slingdata.io">Sling</a> to provide a simple way to sync data
   between databases and file systems.
2. <a href="https://dlthub.com">Data Load Tool (dlt)</a> to easily load data from
   external systems and APIs.

We plan on adding additional embedded ELT tool integrations in the future.
