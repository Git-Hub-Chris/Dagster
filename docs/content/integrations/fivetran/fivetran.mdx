# Using Dagster with Fivetran

This guide provides instructions for using Dagster with Fivetran using the `dagster-fivetran` library. Your Fivetran connector tables can be represented as assets in the Dagster asset graph, allowing you to track lineage and dependencies between Fivetran assets and data assets you are already modeling in Dagster. You can also use Dagster to orchestrate Fivetran connectors, allowing you to trigger syncs for these on a cadence or based on upstream data changes.

## What you'll learn

- How to represent Fivetran assets in the Dagster asset graph, including lineage to other Dagster assets.
- How to customize asset definition metadata for these Fivetran assets.
- How to materialize Fivetran connector tables from Dagster.
- How to customize how Fivetran connector tables are materialized.
