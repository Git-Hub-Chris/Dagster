# Using dbt with Dagster

Dagster orchestrates dbt alongside other technologies, so you can combine dbt with Spark, Python, etc. in a single workflow. Dagster's [software-defined asset (SDA)](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) abstractions make it simple to define data assets that depend on specific dbt models, or to define the computation required to compute the sources that your dbt models depend on.

This guide focuses on how to work with dbt models through the SDA framework, which we recommend for most use cases.

If you're using dbt Cloud, check out [Using dbt Cloud with Dagster](/integrations/dbt_cloud) instead!
