## Using dbt with Dagster

<Note>Using dbt Cloud? Check out the <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-cloud-with-dagster">dbt Cloud with Dagster guide</a>!</Note>

Using Dagster, you can combine dbt and the other technologies in your stack - Spark, Python, and so on - into a single data pipeline. You could, for example:

- Run your dbt models after ingesting data into your data warehouse
- Selectively materialize dbt models and their dependencies
- TODO: what else?

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through integrating dbt with Dagster using dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) and the [dagster-dbt library](/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt). By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand how dbt models and Dagster [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) (or SDAs) work together
- Load existing dbt models into a Dagster project as SDAs 
- Materialize the assets using Dagit, Dagster’s web UI
- Add upstream and downstream dependencies

## dbt models and Dagster software-defined assets

- Section goal: Explain dbt models and Dagster assets; show how they’re alike and fit together. Lead into the tutorial.

Dagster’s [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) (SDAs) bear a number of similarities to dbt models. At a high level, SDAs and dbt models both contain todo

Let’s take a look at a dbt model and an SDA, in code:

Here's what's happening in this example:
