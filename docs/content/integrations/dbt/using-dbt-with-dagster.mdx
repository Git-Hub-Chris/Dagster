# Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets

<Note>
  Using dbt Cloud? Check out the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt-cloud">dbt Cloud with Dagster guide</a>!
</Note>

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through integrating dbt with Dagster using dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), the [dagster-dbt library](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt), and a [DuckDB database](https://duckdb.org/).

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand how dbt models and Dagster [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) (or SDAs) work together
- [Set up a dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-one)
- [Load the dbt models into Dagster as assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two)
- [Create and materialize upstream Dagster assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three)
- [Create and materialize a downstream asset](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-four) that outputs a histogram chart using plotly

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install dbt and Dagster**. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info.

- **An existing dbt project.** This tutorial uses dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), but you can follow along with a different project.

  **Note**: If you choose to use a different project, you won't be able to use the code examples in this tutorial as-is, but you can still follow along conceptually.

- **To install the following libraries:**

  - **dagster-dbt.** This library allows you to integrate dbt with Dagster.

  - **dbt-duckdb.** This tutorial uses [DuckDB](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/duckdb-profile) as the database backing dbt.

  - **dagster-duckdb.** This library provides a resource that enables the materialization of Dagster assets.

  - **pandas.** This tutorial uses [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) to fetch raw data.

  - **plotly**. This tutorial uses [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) to create a histogram asset.

  To install everything, run the following:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster-dbt dbt-duckdb dagster-duckdb pandas plotly
  ```
