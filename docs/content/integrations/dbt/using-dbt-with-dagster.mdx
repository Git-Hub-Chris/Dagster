# Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets

</Note>

Using Dagster, you can combine dbt and the other technologies in your stack - Spark, Python, and so on - into a single data pipeline. You could, for example:

- Run your dbt models after ingesting data into your data warehouse
- Selectively materialize dbt models and their dependencies
- TODO: what else?

## dbt models and Dagster software-defined assets

Dagster’s [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) (SDAs) bear a number of similarities to dbt models. At a high level, SDAs and dbt models both contain todo

Let’s take a look at a dbt model and an SDA, in code:

<TODO>ADD CODE EXAMPLE</TODO>

Here's what's happening in this example:

<TODO></TODO>

## In this tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through integrating dbt with Dagster using dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), the [dagster-dbt library](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt), and a DuckDB database. By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand how dbt models and Dagster [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) (or SDAs) work together
- [Set up a dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-one)
- [Create Dagster assets upstream of the dbt models](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two)
- [Materialize the assets using Dagit](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three), Dagster's web interface
- [Create a downstream asset](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-four) that outputs a histogram chart using plotly

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install the following**:
   - **dbt and Dagster**. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info.
   - **The dbt-duckdb adapter.** This tutorial uses [DuckDB](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/duckdb-profile) as the database backing dbt. Run the following to install the adapter:

    ```shell
    pip install dbt-duckdb
    ```
   - **The dagster-dbt library.** This library allows you to integrate dbt with Dagster. Run the following to install the library:

      ```shell
      pip install dagster-dbt
      ```
   - **The pandas Python library.** This tutorial uses [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) to fetch raw data. Run the following to install the library:

      ```shell
      pip install pandas
      ```
   - **The plotly Python library**. This tutorial uses [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) to create a histogram asset. Run the following to install the library:

   ```shell
   pip install plotly
   ```
- **An existing dbt project.** This tutorial uses dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), but you can follow along with a different project.
