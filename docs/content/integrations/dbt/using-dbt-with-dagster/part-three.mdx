# Using dbt with Dagster, part three: Materialize the assets

<Note>
  This is part three of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">
    Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets
  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

By this point, you've [set up a dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-one) and [created Dagster assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two).

In this step, you'll:

- [Create a Dagster repository and supply resources](#step-1-update-the-dagster-repository-and-supply-resources)
- [Materialize the assets using Dagit](#step-2-materialize-the-assets-using-dagit)

---

## Step 1: Update the Dagster repository and supply resources

Next, you'll update the Dagster [repository](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories) to supply resources to the assets from the [previous step](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two).

In the `dbt_dagster_tutorial` folder, open the `repository.py` file and replace its contents with the following:

<TODO></TODO>

```python
REPLACE CODE SNIPPET
```

Let's review what's happening here:

- The <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_cli_resource" /> resource supplies a dbt resource to the dbt project. This resource executes dbt CLI commands against the dbt project.

- Supplies the `duckdb_io_manager` resource to the assets in the repository. This resource contains an [I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) that, when assets are materialized, allows:

  - Upstream assets (`customers_raw`, `orders_raw`) to load data into DuckDB
  - Downstream assets to read data from DuckDB. We'll add the downstream asset in the next section.

## Step 2: Materialize the assets using Dagit

Now that you've created assets, resources, and a repository, it's time to materialize the assets! Materializing an asset runs the op it contains and saves the results to persistent storage. In this tutorial, we're saving asset outputs to DuckDB.

In this step, you'll materialize the assets using Dagit.

1. To start Dagit, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagit
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the assets:

   <Image
   alt="Asset graph in Dagit, containing dbt models and Dagster assets"
   src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three-asset-graph.png"
   width={996}
   height={810}
   />

3. Click the **Materialize all** button near the top right corner of the page, which will launch a run to materialize the assets.

After the run completes, you can:

- Click the **asset** to open a sidebar containing info about the asset, including its last materialization stats, a link to view the [**Asset details** page](/concepts/dagit/dagit#asset-details)
- Click the ID of the **Latest Run** in an asset to view the [**Run details**](/concepts/dagit/dagit#viewing-a-single-run) page. This page contains detailed info about the run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

<TODO></TODO>

- Should we show the final output of the assets in DuckDB?

## What's next?

At this point, you've built and materialized two upstream Dagster assets, providing source data to your dbt models. In the next section, we'll show you how to add a [downstream asset to the pipeline](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-four).
