# Using dbt with Dagster, part two: Load dbt models as Dagster assets

<Note>
  This is part two of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">
    Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets
  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

At this point, you should have a [fully-configured dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-one) that's ready to work with Dagster.

In this step, you'll finally begin integrating dbt with Dagster! To do this, you'll:

- [Create a new folder for your Dagster code](#step-1-create-a-folder-for-dagster-code)
- [Load the dbt models into Dagster as assets](#step-2-load-the-dbt-models-as-assets)
- [Add a Dagster repository and supply a dbt resource](#step-3-add-a-dagster-repository-and-supply-a-dbt-resource)
- [View the assets in Dagit](#step-4-view-the-assets-in-dagit)

---

## Step 1: Create a folder for Dagster code

To get started, create a new folder in the `dbt_dagster_tutorial` folder to contain your Dagster code:

```shell
mkdir dagster_code
```

The folder structure should now be similar to the following:

```markdown file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_dagster_tutorial/project_structure.yaml startafter=part_two_structure_start endbefore=part_two_structure_end
- /dbt_dagster_tutorial
  - /dagster_code
  - /jaffle_shop
    - README.md
    - dbt_project.yml
    - /models
      - customers.sql
      - orders.sql
      - schema.yml
      - /staging
        - schema.yml
        - stg_customers.sql
        - stg_orders.sql
    - /seeds
```

---

## Step 2: Load the dbt models as assets

Next, we'll load the dbt models into Dagster as assets. This step requires the [`dagster-dbt`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt) library.

In the `dagster_code` folder, create an `assets.py` file that contains the following code:

```python
from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_project
from dagster._utils import file_relative_path

DBT_PROJECT_PATH = file_relative_path(__file__, "../jaffle_shop")
DBT_PROFILES = file_relative_path(__file__, "../jaffle_shop/config")

dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_project(
   project_dir=DBT_PROJECT_PATH, profiles_dir=DBT_PROFILES, key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"]
)
```

Let's discuss what this example is doing, specifically the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> function. This function loads dbt models into Dagster as assets, creating one Dagster asset for each model.

When invoked, this function:

1. Compiles your dbt project,
2. Parses the metadata provided by dbt, and
3. Generates a set of software-defined assets reflecting the models in the project. These assets share the same underlying [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops), which will invoke dbt to run the models represented by the loaded assets.

<Note>
  <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> is one
  of two ways you can load dbt models into Dagster, which we recommend for small
  dbt projects. For larger projects, we recommend using
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/reference#loading-models-using-load_assets_from_dbt_manifest">
    <code>load_assets_from_dbt_manifest</code> to load models from a dbt{" "}
    <code>manifest.json</code> file
  </a>.
</Note>

Let's take a look at the arguments we've supplied:

- `project_dir`, which is the path to the dbt project
- `profiles_dir`, which is the path to the dbt project's connection profiles
- `key_prefix`, which is a prefix to apply to all models in the dbt project

---

## Step 3: Add a Dagster repository and supply a dbt resource

Next, you'll create a Dagster [repository](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories) to supply resources to the dbt assets from the previous step.

Assets loaded from dbt require a dbt resource, which is responsible for firing off dbt CLI commands. Using the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_cli_resource" /> resource, we can supply a dbt resource to the dbt project.

In the `dagster_code` folder, create a `repository.py` file that contains the following code:

```python
import os

from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource

from dagster_code.assets import (
    DBT_PROFILES,
    DBT_PROJECT_PATH,
    dbt_assets,
)


from dagster import repository, with_resources


@repository
def jaffle_shop_repository():
    return with_resources(
        [
            *dbt_assets,
        ],
        {
            "dbt": dbt_cli_resource.configured(
                {
                    "project_dir": DBT_PROJECT_PATH,
                    "profiles_dir": DBT_PROFILES,
                },
            ),
        },
    )

```

At this point, the folder structure of your project should look like this:

```markdown file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_dagster_tutorial/project_structure.yaml startafter=part_two_step_3_structure_start endbefore=part_two_step_3_structure_end
- /dbt_dagster_tutorial
  - /dagster_code
    - assets.py
    - repository.py
  - /jaffle_shop
    - README.md
    - dbt_project.yml
    - /models
      - customers.sql
      - orders.sql
      - schema.yml
      - /staging
        - schema.yml
        - stg_customers.sql
        - stg_orders.sql
    - /seeds
```

---

## Step 4: View the assets in Dagit

In this step you'll start Dagit, Dagster's web interface.

1. To start Dagit, run the following in the `dbt_dagster_tutorial` folder:

   ```shell
   dagit
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the assets:

   <Image
   alt="Asset graph in Dagit, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets"
   src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two-dbt-asset-graph.png"
   width={1090}
   height={894}
   />

---

## What's next?

At this point, you've loaded your dbt models into Dagster as assets, supplied them with a dbt resource, and viewed them in Dagit's asset graph. The next step is to [add upstream Dagster assets and kick off a run that materializes them](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three).
