# Quickstart: Run your dbt project with Dagster

<Note>
  <strong>Note</strong>: This guide uses the <code>DbtProject</code> class, which
  is an experimental feature. Visit the{" "}
  <a href="/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt">
    dagster-dbt library API reference
  </a>{" "}
  for more info.
</Note>

If you just want to see the code of the example, skip to the end on this guide.

<div className="w-full inline-flex flex-col space-y-2 md:space-y-0 md:flex-row md:space-x-4">
  <Button link="#using-dbt-with-dagster-in-a-single-file">See the code</Button>
</div>

## Setup your environment

<Note>
  <strong>Note</strong>: We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a
  Python virtualenv. Visit the{" "}
  <a href="/getting-started/install">Dagster installation docs</a> for more
  info.
</Note>

Install dbt, Dagster, and the Dagster webserver/UI\*\*. Run the following to install everything using pip:

```shell
pip install dagster-dbt dagster-webserver
```

The `dagster-dbt` library installs both `dbt-core` and `dagster` as dependencies. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info.

## Run your dbt project in Dagster's UI

Now that your code is ready, you can run Dagster's UI to take a look at your dbt project.

1. Change directories to the Dagster project directory:

   ```shell
   cd my-dagster-project/
   ```

2. To start Dagster's UI, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagster dev
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

3. In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the asset graph for the job created by the schedule definition:

  <!--
  ![Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets](/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset_graph.png)
  -->

<Image
alt="Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets"
src="/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset_graph.png"
width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

3. In Dagster, running a dbt model corresponds to _materializing_ an asset. Because a schedule definition has been added to your code location, your assets will be materialized at the next cron tick. The assets can also be materialized manually by click the **Materialize all** button near the top right corner of the page. This will launch a run to materialize the assets.

## Using dbt with Dagster in a single file

Running your dbt project with Dagster can be easily done after creating a single file. For this example, let's consider a basic use case - say you want to represent your dbt models as Dagster assets and run them daily at midnight.

With your text editor of choice, create a Python file in the same directory as your dbt project directory and add the following code. Note that since this file contains [all Dagster definitions required for your code location](/concepts/code-locations), it is recommended to name it `definitions.py`.

The following code assumes that your Python file and dbt project directory are adjacent in the same directory. If that's not the case, make sure to update the `RELATIVE_PATH_TO_YOUR_DBT_PROJECT` constant so that it points to your dbt project.

```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from pathlib import Path

from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, Definitions
from dagster_dbt import (
    DbtCliResource,
    DbtProject,
    build_schedule_from_dbt_selection,
    dbt_assets,
)

RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT = "./my-dbt-project"

my_project = DbtProject(
    project_dir=Path(__file__)
    .joinpath("..", RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT)
    .resolve(),
)


@dbt_assets(manifest=my_project.manifest_path)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()


my_schedule = build_schedule_from_dbt_selection(
    [my_dbt_assets],
    job_name="materialize_dbt_models",
    cron_schedule="0 0 * * *",
    dbt_select="fqn:*",
)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[my_dbt_assets],
    schedules=[my_schedule],
    resources={
        "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=my_project),
    },
)
```

## What's next?

Congratulations on successfully running your dbt project in Dagster!

In this example, we created a single file to handle a simple use case and run your dbt project. To learn more about our dbt integrations and how to handle more complex use cases, consider the following options:

- To find out more about integrating dbt with Dagster, begin the official dbt scaffold tutorial, like the [dbt & Dagster project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster).
- For an end-to-end example, from the project creation to the deployment to Dagster+, checkout out the Dagster & dbt course in [Dagster University](https://courses.dagster.io).
