# Deltalake + Dagster

Using Dagster's [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and Deltalake I/O manager,
you can easily interact with DuckDB tables alongside other Dagster assets.

Managing your Delta tables with Dagster enables you to:

- Use Python to analyze your data stored in Delta without writing custom SQL queries to fetch the data
- Visualize the data dependencies between tables
- Selectively update the contents of your tables
- Integrate your Delta tables with other tools in your data stack
