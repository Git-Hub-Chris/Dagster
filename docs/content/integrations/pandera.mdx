# Using Dagster with Pandera

The `dagster-pandera` integration library provides an API for generating [Dagster Types](/concepts/types) from [Pandera](https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera) dataframe schemas. Like all Dagster types, `dagster-pandera`-generated types can be used to annotate op inputs and outputs. This provides runtime type-checking with rich error reporting and allows [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit) to display information about a dataframe's structure.

<Note>
  Though Pandera currently supports validation on DataFrames from a variety of
  Pandas alternatives (e.g. Dask, Modin, Koalas), at this time{" "}
  <code>dagster-pandera</code>
  only supports Pandas dataframes.
</Note>

## Usage

`dagster-pandera` exposes only a single public function: `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type`. This function generates Dagster types from Pandera schemas. The Dagster type wraps the Pandera schema and will invoke the schema's `validate()` method inside its type check function.

```python file=/integrations/pandera/example.py
import random

import pandas as pd
import pandera as pa
from dagster_pandera import pandera_schema_to_dagster_type
from pandera.typing import Series

from dagster import Out, job, op

APPLE_STOCK_PRICES = {
    "name": ["AAPL", "AAPL", "AAPL", "AAPL", "AAPL"],
    "date": ["2018-01-22", "2018-01-23", "2018-01-24", "2018-01-25", "2018-01-26"],
    "open": [177.3, 177.3, 177.25, 174.50, 172.0],
    "close": [177.0, 177.04, 174.22, 171.11, 171.51],
}


class StockPrices(pa.SchemaModel):
    """Open/close prices for one or more stocks by day."""

    name: Series[str] = pa.Field(description="Ticker symbol of stock")
    date: Series[str] = pa.Field(description="Date of prices")
    open: Series[float] = pa.Field(ge=0, description="Price at market open")
    close: Series[float] = pa.Field(ge=0, description="Price at market close")


@op(out=Out(dagster_type=pandera_schema_to_dagster_type(StockPrices)))
def apple_stock_prices_dirty():
    prices = pd.DataFrame(APPLE_STOCK_PRICES)
    i = random.choice(prices.index)
    prices.loc[i, "open"] = pd.NA
    prices.loc[i, "close"] = pd.NA
    return prices


@job
def stocks_job():
    apple_stock_prices_dirty()
```

In the above code, we've defined a toy job `stocks_job` with a single asset, `apple_stock_prices_dirty`, which returns a Pandas `DataFrame` containing the opening and closing prices of Apple stock (AAPL) for a random week. The `_dirty` suffix is included because we've corrupted the data with a few random nulls.

Let's look at this job in `dagit`:

<Image
alt="PLACEHOLDER"
src="/images/guides/dagster_pandera/schema.png"
width={2662}
height={1748}
/>

Notice that information from the `StockPrices` Pandera schema is rendered in the asset detail area of the right sidebar. This is possible because `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type` extracts this information from the Pandera schema and attaches it to the returned Dagster type.

If we try to run `stocks_job` our run will fail. This is expected-- our (dirty) data contains nulls, and Pandera columns are non-nullable by default. The Dagster Type returned by `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type` contains a type check function that calls `StockPrices.validate()`. This is invoked automatically on the return value of `apple_stock_prices_dirty`, leading to a type check failure. You can see Pandera's full output in the `STEP_OUTPUT` event:

<Image
alt="PLACEHOLDER"
src="/images/guides/dagster_pandera/error-report.png"
width={2662}
height={1748}
/>

And that's it! In summary, `dagster-pandera`'s dead simple API provides:

- Visualization of the shape of tabular data as it flows through our DAGs.
- Seamless runtime type checks using Pandera's rich dataframe validation capabilities.
