# Using Dagster with Pandera

The `dagster-pandera` integration library provides an API for generating [Dagster Types](/concepts/types) from [Pandera](https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera) dataframe schemas. Like all Dagster types, `dagster-pandera`-generated types can be used to annotate op inputs and outputs. This provides runtime type-checking with rich error reporting and allows [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit) to display information about a dataframe's structure.

## Usage

`dagster-pandera` currently exposes only a single public function: `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type`. This function generates Dagster types from Pandera schemas. The Dagster type wraps the Pandera schema and will invoke the schema's `validate()` method inside its type check function.

```python file=/integrations/pandera/example.py
import random
import pandera as pa
from pandera.typing import Series
import pandas as pd
from dagster import asset, define_assets_job
from dagster_pandera import pandera_schema_to_dagster_type


APPLE_STOCK_PRICES = {
  "name": ["AAPL","AAPL","AAPL","AAPL","AAPL"]
  "date": [pd.Timestamp(date) for date in [
    "2018-01-22", "2018-01-23", "2018-01-24", "2018-01-25", "2018-01-26"
  ]],
  "open": [177.3,177.3,177.25,174.50,172.0],
  "close": [177.0, 177.04, 174.22, 171.11, 171.51],
}

class StockPrices(pa.SchemaModel):
    """Open/close prices for one or more stocks by day."""

    name: Series[str] = pa.Field(description="Ticker symbol of stock")
    date: Series[pd.Timestamp] = pa.Field(description="Date of prices")
    open: Series[float] = pa.Field(ge=0, description="Price at market open")
    close: Series[float] = pa.Field(ge=0, description="Price at market close")

@op(
    out=Out(dagster_type=pandera_schema_to_dagster_type(StockPrices))
)
def apple_stock_prices_dirty():
    df = pd.DataFrame(APPLE_STOCK_PRICES)
    i = random.choice(df.index)
    df.loc[i, 'open'] = pd.NA
    df.loc[i, 'close'] = pd.NA
    return prices

stocks_job = build_assets_job("stock_prices", assets=[sp500_prices_dirty])
```

In the above code, we've defined a toy job `stocks_job` with a single asset,
`apple_stock_prices_dirty`, which returns a Pandas `DataFrame` containing the
opening and closing prices of Apple stock (AAPL) for a random week. The
`_dirty` suffix is included because we've corrupted the data with a few random
nulls.

Let's look at this job in `dagit`:

<Image
alt="PLACEHOLDER"
src="/images/guides/dagster_pandera/job-before-run.png"
width={3574}
height={2020}
/>

Notice that information from the `StockPrices` Pandera schema is rendered in
the asset detail area of the right sidebar. This is possible because
`pandera_schema_to_dagster_type` extracts this information from the Pandera schema and
attaches it to the returned Dagster type. 

Now let's see what happens if we try to materialize the
`apple_stock_prices_dirty` asset:

<Image
alt="PLACEHOLDER"
src="/images/guides/dagster_pandera/job-after-run.png"
width={3574}
height={2020}
/>

In the event log, you can see that the type check failed. This is expected--
our data contained nulls, and Pandera columns are non-nullable by default. You
can also see that the failed type check includes several useful pieces of
metadata: `num_failures` for the total number of failed checks, `Failure cases
(first 10)` containing the `failure_cases` table returned by `pandera`, and
`schema` containing the schema for what was expected.
