# Create a New Project

The easiest way to start building a Dagster project is by using the `dagster project` CLI. This CLI tool helps generates files and folder structures that enables you to quickly get started with Dagster. You can scaffold a new project using the default project skeleton, or start with using one of the official Dagster examples.

## Option 1: Starting with an empty project skeleton

To get started, you can run:

```bash
pip install dagster
dagster project scaffold --name my-dagster-project
```

The command `dagster project scaffold` will generate a folder structure with a single Dagster repository and other boilerplate files such as [`workspace.yaml`](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces). This helps you to quickly start with an empty project with everything set up.

## Option 2: Starting with an official example

To get started, you can run:

```bash
pip install dagster
dagster project from-example --name my-dagster-project --example project_fully_featured
```

The command `dagster project from-example` will download one of the official Dagster examples to the current directory. This CLI enables you to quickly bootstrap your project with an officially maintained example.

To find out the available examples, you can visit the [Dagster GitHub repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples) or use `dagster project list-example`.

## Getting started

The newly generated `my-dagster-project` directory is in fact a fully functioning [Python package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) and can be installed with `pip`. To install it as a package and its Python dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

<Note>
  By using the `--editable` flag, `pip` will install your repository in{" "}
  <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/?highlight=editable#editable-installsl">
    "editable mode"
  </a>{" "}
  so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.
</Note>

Then, start the Dagit web server:

```bash
dagit
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the project.

Now, you can start writing assets in `my_dagster_project/assets/`. The assets are automatically loaded into the Dagster repository as you define them.

## Development

### Adding new Python dependencies

You can specify new Python dependencies in `setup.py`.

### Unit testing

Tests can be added in the `my_dagster_project_tests` directory and you can run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest my_dagster_project_tests_tests
```

### Schedules and sensors

If you want to enable Dagster [Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or [Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) for your jobs, start the [Dagster Daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) process in the same folder as your `workspace.yaml` file, but in a different shell or terminal.

The `$DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable must be set to a directory for the daemon to work. Note: using directories within /tmp may cause issues. See [Dagster Instance default local behavior](/deployment/dagster-instance#default-local-behavior) for more details.

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

Once your Dagster Daemon is running, you can start turning on schedules and sensors for your jobs.

## Deployment

Once your project is ready for moving to production, check out our recommendation for [Transitioning Data Pipelines from Development to Production](/guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production).

Visit the [Deployment Guides](/deployment) to learn more how to run Dagster in production environments, such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EC2, etc.
