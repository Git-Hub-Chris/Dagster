# Hello Dagster

This guide helps you build a simple data pipeline in dagster that downloads the top 10 HackerNews stories.

Start by creating a file called `hello-dagster.py` and copying the following:

```python file=/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster.py
import pandas as pd
import requests

from dagster import MetadataValue, Output, asset, repository


@asset
def hackernews_top_story_ids():
    """
    Get top stories from the HackerNews top stories endpoint.
    API Docs: https://github.com/HackerNews/API#new-top-and-best-stories
    """
    top_story_ids = requests.get(
        "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
    ).json()
    return top_story_ids[:10]


# asset dependencies can be inferred from inputs
@asset
def hackernews_top_stories(hackernews_top_story_ids):
    """Get items based on story ids from the HackerNews items endpoint"""

    results = []
    for item_id in hackernews_top_story_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    # recorded metadata can be customized
    metadata = {
        "num_records": len(df),
        "preview": MetadataValue.md(df.to_markdown()),
    }

    return Output(value=df, metadata=metadata)


@repository
def hello_dagster():
    return [hackernews_top_story_ids, hackernews_top_stories]
```

Now install the Python packages we'll need to run `hello-dagster.py` in your favorite Python environment. Unsure? Follow our [installation guide](/getting-started/install).

```bash
# run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
pip install dagster dagit pandas
```

We'll use `dagit`, the dagster user interface, to run `hello-dagster.py`:

```bash
# run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
dagit -f hello-dagster.py
```

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`. Clicking `Materialize All` will run our pipeline and create our assets.

The `hackernews_top_stories` asset included `metadata`. Click on the asset and then `Show Markdown` to preview the pipeline result and view the top HackerNews stories.

## Next Steps

This example uses [assets](/tutorial#assets). Most new Dagster projects use assets because they let data engineers:

- think in the same terms as stakeholders
- answer questions about data quality and lineage
- work with the modern data stack (dbt, Airbyte/Fivetran, Spark)
- create declarative freshness policies instead of task-driven cron schedules

Dagster also offers [ops and jobs](/tutorial#ops-and-jobs), but we recommend starting with assets.

Our `hello-dagster` example used a single file, but most Dagster projects are organized as Python packages. Check out our [getting started guide](/getting-started/create-new-project) to begin with a scaffolded blank project or start from an official example such as this [dagster + dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster).
