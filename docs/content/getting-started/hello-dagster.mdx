# `hello dagster`

This guide helps you build a simple data pipeline in dagster that downloads the top 10 HackerNews stories.

1. Start by creating a file called `hello-dagster.py` and copying the following:

    ```python file=/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster.py
    ```

2. Now install the Python packages we'll need to run `hello-dagster.py` in your favorite Python environment. Unsure? Follow our [installation guide](/getting-started/install).

    ```bash
    # run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
    pip install dagster dagit pandas
    ```

3. We'll use `dagit`, the dagster user interface, to run `hello-dagster.py`:

    ```bash
    # run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
    dagit -f hello-dagster.py
    ```

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`. Clicking `Materialize All` will run our pipeline and create our assets.

## Next Steps

This example uses [assets](/tutorial#assets). Most new Dagster projects use assets because they let data engineers:

- think in the same terms as stakeholders
- answer questions about data quality and lineage 
- work with the modern data stack (dbt, Airbyte/Fivetran, Spark)
- create declarative freshness policies instead of task-driven cron schedules

Dagster also offers [ops and jobs](/tutorial#ops-and-jobs), but we recommend starting with assets.

Our `hello-dagster` example used a single file, but most Dagster projects are organized as Python packages. Check out our [getting started guide](/getting-started/create-new-project/) to begin with a scaffolded blank project or start from an official example such as this [dagster + dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster).
