# Hello Dagster

This guide helps you build a simple data pipeline in dagster that downloads the top 10 HackerNews stories. In less than 5 minutes you will be able to develop functional code and explore dagster's user interface.

Start by creating a file called `hello-dagster.py` and copying the following:

```python file=/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster.py
import pandas as pd
import requests

from dagster import MetadataValue, Output, asset, repository


@asset
def hackernews_top_story_ids():
    """
    Get top stories from the HackerNews top stories endpoint.
    API Docs: https://github.com/HackerNews/API#new-top-and-best-stories
    """
    top_story_ids = requests.get(
        "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
    ).json()
    return top_story_ids[:10]


# asset dependencies can be inferred from inputs
@asset
def hackernews_top_stories(hackernews_top_story_ids):
    """Get items based on story ids from the HackerNews items endpoint"""

    results = []
    for item_id in hackernews_top_story_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    # recorded metadata can be customized
    metadata = {
        "num_records": len(df),
        "preview": MetadataValue.md(df.to_markdown()),
    }

    return Output(value=df, metadata=metadata)


@repository
def hello_dagster():
    return [hackernews_top_story_ids, hackernews_top_stories]
```

Install the Python packages you'll need to run `hello-dagster.py` in your favorite Python environment. Unsure? Follow our [installation guide](/getting-started/install).

```bash
# run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
pip install dagster dagit pandas
```

Next, run `dagit` in your terminal in the same directory as `hello-dagster.py`. This command starts Dagster's user interface.

```bash
# run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
dagit -f hello-dagster.py
```

In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000). Click **Materialize All** to run the pipeline and create your assets.

<Image
alt="HackerNews asset graph"
src="/images/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster.png"
width={1331}
height={874}
/>

That's it! You now have two materialized Dagster assets.

But wait - there's more. Because the `hackernews_top_stories` asset specified `metadata`, you can view the metadata right in Dagit.

Click the asset. In the sidebar that displays, click the **Show Markdown** link in the **Materialization in Last Run** section. This opens a preview of the pipeline result, allowing you to view the top 10 HackerNews stories:

## Next steps

This example uses [assets](/tutorial#assets). Most new Dagster projects use assets because they let data engineers:

- Think in the same terms as stakeholders
- Answer questions about data quality and lineage
- Work with the modern data stack (dbt, Airbyte/Fivetran, Spark)
- Create declarative freshness policies instead of task-driven cron schedules

Dagster also offers [ops and jobs](/tutorial#ops-and-jobs), but we recommend starting with assets.

While this example used a single file, most Dagster projects are organized as Python packages. From here, you can:

- Start with a scaffolded blank project. Check out the [new project guide](/getting-started/create-new-project) for more info.
- Start with an official example, such as the [dbt + Dagster project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster). Check out [all the examples in GitHub](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples).
