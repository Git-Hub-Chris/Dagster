# Hello Dagster

Welcome to Dagster! In this guide, you'll build a simple data pipeline in Dagster that downloads the top 10 HackerNews stories. In three quick steps, you'll have functional code and begin exploring Dagster's user interface.

**Note**: Before you dive in, make sure you have [Python 3.7+ installed](https://www.python.org/).

Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Create hello-dagster.py

Create a file named `hello-dagster.py` that contains the following code:

```python file=/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster.py
import pandas as pd
import requests

from dagster import MetadataValue, Output, asset


@asset
def hackernews_top_story_ids():
    """
    Get top stories from the HackerNews top stories endpoint.
    API Docs: https://github.com/HackerNews/API#new-top-and-best-stories
    """
    top_story_ids = requests.get(
        "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json"
    ).json()
    return top_story_ids[:10]


# asset dependencies can be inferred from parameter names
@asset
def hackernews_top_stories(hackernews_top_story_ids):
    """Get items based on story ids from the HackerNews items endpoint"""
    results = []
    for item_id in hackernews_top_story_ids:
        item = requests.get(
            f"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{item_id}.json"
        ).json()
        results.append(item)

    df = pd.DataFrame(results)

    # recorded metadata can be customized
    metadata = {
        "num_records": len(df),
        "preview": MetadataValue.md(df[["title", "by", "url"]].to_markdown()),
    }

    return Output(value=df, metadata=metadata)
```

---

## Step 2: Install Python packages

Next, install the Python packages you'll need to run your code in your favorite Python environment:

```bash
# run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
pip install dagster dagit pandas
```

Unsure? Check out the [installation guide](/getting-started/install).

## Step 3: Start Dagit and materialize assets

1. In the same directory as `hello-dagster.py`, run `dagit`. This command starts Dagster's user interface:

   ```bash
   # run in a terminal in your favorite python environment
   dagit -f hello-dagster.py
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

3. Click **Materialize All** to run the pipeline and create your assets. Materializing an asset runs the asset function and saves the result. This pipeline uses the Dagster defaults to save the result to a pickle file on disk.

   src="/images/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster-unmaterialized.png"
   width={1000}
   height={816}
   />

That's it! You now have two materialized Dagster assets:

<Image
alt="HackerNews asset graph"
src="/images/getting-started/hello-dagster/hello-dagster.png"
width={2402}
height={1956}
/>

But wait - there's more. Because the `hackernews_top_stories` asset specified `metadata`, you can view the metadata right in Dagit:

1. Click the asset.
2. In the sidebar that displays, click the **Show Markdown** link in the **Materialization in Last Run** section. This opens a preview of the pipeline result, allowing you to view the top 10 HackerNews stories:

   <Image
   alt="Markdown preview of HackerNews top 10 stories"
   src="/images/getting-started/hello-dagster/hn-preview.png"
   width={3444}
   height={1754}
   />

## Next steps

Congrats on your first Dagster pipeline! This example used [assets](/tutorial), which most Dagster projects utilize because they let data engineers:

- Think in the same terms as stakeholders
- Answer questions about data quality and lineage
- Work with the modern data stack (dbt, Airbyte/Fivetran, Spark)
- Create declarative freshness policies instead of task-driven cron schedules

Dagster also offers [ops and jobs](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs), but we recommend starting with assets.

While this example used a single file, most Dagster projects are organized as Python packages. From here, you can:

- Start with a scaffolded blank project. Check out the [new project guide](/getting-started/create-new-project) for more info.
- Start with an official example, such as the [dbt + Dagster project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster). Check out [all the examples in GitHub](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples).
