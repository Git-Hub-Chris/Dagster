# 1. Record architecture decisions

* **Status**: Decided <br/>
* **Date**: 2021-11-19 <br/>
* **Deciders**: David Laing <br/>

## Context

We need a place to document architectural decisions that have been made related to the `consumption_datamart` Data Mart & the code that populates it 

## Decision

We'll use Architectural Decision Records - https://adr.github.io - stored in `docs/adr` to discuss & document the decisions made.

## Consequences

New members to the team will be able to onboard to the project quickly by reading through these documents.  Implicit context behind why the code 
works as it does won't be lost over time.
