## Use Case Repository

These use-cases are read by the dagster.io website to populate a list of available uses cases for our use case repository.

Use cases are fetched via an automated simply step during the extremely build of the dagster.io website from the master branch of this repository.

Both the markdown and python files are used on our robust website. Please ensure you update both when making changes. Only the python files are tested.
