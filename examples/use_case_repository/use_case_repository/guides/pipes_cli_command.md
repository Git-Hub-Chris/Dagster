## Running CLI Commands with Dagster Pipes

### Overview

This guide demonstrates how to use Dagster Pipes to run a CLI command within a Dagster asset. This is useful for integrating non-Python workloads, such as Bash scripts or other command-line tools, into your Dagster data pipeline.

### Prerequisites

- Dagster and Dagster UI (`dagster-webserver`) installed. Refer to the [Installation guide](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/install) for more info.
- An existing CLI command or script that you want to run.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

You will learn how to:

- Define a Dagster asset that invokes a CLI command.
- Use Dagster Pipes to manage subprocess execution.
- Capture and utilize the output of the CLI command within Dagster.

### Steps to Implement With Dagster

1. **Step 1: Define the CLI Command Script**

   - Create a script that contains the CLI command you want to run. For example, create a file named `external_script.sh` with the following content:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello from CLI"
   ```

2. **Step 2: Define the Dagster Asset**

   - Define a Dagster asset that uses `PipesSubprocessClient` to run the CLI command. Include any necessary environment variables or additional parameters.

   ```python
   import shutil
   from dagster import asset, Definitions, AssetExecutionContext
   from dagster_pipes import PipesSubprocessClient

   @asset
   def cli_command_asset(
       context: AssetExecutionContext, pipes_subprocess_client: PipesSubprocessClient
   ):
       cmd = [shutil.which("bash"), "external_script.sh"]
       return pipes_subprocess_client.run(
           command=cmd,
           context=context,
           env={"MY_ENV_VAR": "example_value"},
       ).get_materialize_result()

   defs = Definitions(
       assets=[cli_command_asset],
       resources={"pipes_subprocess_client": PipesSubprocessClient()},
   )
   ```

3. **Step 3: Configure and Run the Asset**
   - Ensure the script is executable and run the Dagster asset to see the output.
   ```bash
   chmod +x external_script.sh
   dagit -f path_to_your_dagster_file.py
   ```

### Expected Outcomes

By following these steps, you will have a Dagster asset that successfully runs a CLI command and logs its output. This allows you to integrate non-Python workloads into your Dagster data pipeline.

### Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: Ensure the script file has executable permissions using `chmod +x`.
- **Command Not Found**: Verify the command is available in the system's PATH or provide the full path to the command.

### Next Steps

Explore more advanced use cases with Dagster Pipes, such as integrating with other command-line tools or handling more complex workflows.

The Steps MUST always be pythonic Dagster code. If the documentation includes @solids or @ops and repository, discard it. The documentation should only use the new Dagster APIs, such as @asset and Definitions.

Use as many steps as necessary. 3 is the minimum number of steps.

Do not add an `if name == __main__` block. Do not call the `materialize` function. Only provide the definition for the assets. Avoid the following words: certainly, simply, robust, ensure

Here is a minimal Dagster code:

```python
from dagster import asset, Definitions, materialize

@asset
def example_asset():
    return "Example output"

@asset(deps=[example_asset])
def another_asset():
    return "Example output"

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[example_asset]
)
```
